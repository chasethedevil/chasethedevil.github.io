      <title>The Neural Network in Your CPU</title>

      <description>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are the current hype (again). In their new Ryzen processors, AMD advertises the Neural Net Prediction. It turns out this is was already used in their older (2012) Piledriver architecture used for example in the AMD A10-4600M. It is also present in recent Samsung processors such as the one powering the Galaxy S7. What is it really?
The basic idea can be traced to a paper from Daniel Jimenez and Calvin Lin &amp;ldquo;Dynamic Branch Prediction with Perceptrons&amp;rdquo;, more precisely described in the subsequent paper &amp;ldquo;Neural methods for dynamic branch prediction&amp;rdquo;. <a href="/post/the_neural_network_in_your_cpu/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Benham disc in web canvas</title>

      <description>Around 15 years ago, I wrote a small Java applet to try and show the Benham disk effect. Even back then applets were already passé and Flash would have been more appropriate. These days, no browser support Java applets anymore, and very few web users have Java installed. Flash also mostly disappeared. The web canvas is today&amp;rsquo;s standard allowing to embbed animations in a web page.
This effect shows color perception from a succession of black and white pictures. <a href="/post/benham_disc_in_web_canvas/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.</p></description>

      <title>Blogs on Quantitative Finance</title>

      <description>There are not many blogs on quantitative finance that I read. Blogs are not so popular anymore with the advent of the various social networks (facebook, stackoverflow, google plus, reddit, &amp;hellip;). Here is a small list:
 Clarus FT: often interesting statistics on the swap market, clearing, plus the more technical articles from Gary. Quants R Us: A relatively new blog with a promising starting post analyzing Andreasen-Huge one-step local-volatility algorithm with a Spline Fooling around with Quantlib: the blog from Peter Caspers, also relevant to non-Quantlib professionals has original insights such as Smile dynamics by densities or the Supernatural Libor Coupons. <a href="/post/quantitative_finance_blogs/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Typo in Hyman non-negative constraint - 28 years later</title>
      <link>http://chasethedevil.github.io/post/typo-in-hyman-non-negative-constraint/</link>

      <description>In their paper &amp;ldquo;Nonnegativity-, Monotonicity-, or Convexity-Preserving Cubic and Quintic Hermite Interpolation&amp;rdquo;, Dougherty, Edelman and Hyman present a simple filter on the first derivatives to maintain positivity of a cubic spline interpolant.
Unfortunately, in their main formula for non-negativity, they made a typo: the equation (3.3) is not consistent with the equation (3.1): the \( \Delta x_{i-1&amp;frasl;2} \) is interverted with \( \Delta x_{i+1&amp;frasl;2} \).
It was not obvious to find out which equation was wrong since there is no proof in the paper. <a href="/post/typo-in-hyman-non-negative-constraint/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Implied Volatility from Black-Scholes price</title>
      <link>http://chasethedevil.github.io/post/implied-volatility-from-black-scholes-price/</link>

      <description>Dan Stefanica and Rados Radoicic propose a quite good initial guess in their very recent paper An Explicit Implied Volatility Formula. Their formula is simple, fast to compute and results in an implied volatility guess with a relative error of less than 10%.
It is more robust than the rational fraction from Minquiang Li: his rational fraction is only valid for a fixed range of strikes and maturities. The new approximation is mathematically proved accurate across all strikes and all maturities. <a href="/post/implied-volatility-from-black-scholes-price/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>The VIX starts smiling</title>

      <description>The VIX implied volatilities used to look like a logarithmic function of the strikes. I don&amp;rsquo;t look at them often, but today, I noticed that the VIX had the start of a smile shape.
 1m VIX implied volatilities on March 21, 2017 with strictly positive volume.   Very few strikes trades below the VIX future level (12.9). All of this is likely because the VIX is unusually low: not many people are looking to trade it much lower. <a href="/post/vix-starts-smiling/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>When SVI Breaks Down</title>

      <description>In order to fit the implied volatility smile of equity options, one of the most popular parameterization is Jim Gatheral&amp;rsquo;s SVI, which I have written about before here.
It turns out that in the current market conditions, SVI does not work well for short maturities. SPX options expiring on March 24, 2017 (one week) offer a good example. I paid attention to include only options with non zero volume, that is options that are actually traded. <a href="/post/when-svi-breaks-down/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Brownian Bridge and Discrete Random Variables</title>

      <guid>http://chasethedevil.github.io/post/brownian-bridge-and-discrete-sampling/</guid>
      <description>The new Heston discretisation scheme I wrote about a few weeks ago makes use a discrete random variable matching the first five moments of the normal distribution instead of the usual normally distributed random variable, computed via the inverse cumulative distribution function. Their discrete random variable is: $$\xi = \sqrt{1-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}} \quad \text{ if } U_1 &amp;lt; 3\,,$$ $$ \xi =-\sqrt{1-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}} \quad \text{ if } U_1 &amp;gt; 4\,,$$ $$\xi = \sqrt{1+\sqrt{6}} \quad \text{ if } U_1 = 3\,,$$ $$\xi = -\sqrt{1+\sqrt{6}} \quad \text{ if } U_1 = 4\,,$$ with \(U_1 \in \{0,1,&amp;hellip;,7\}\) <a href="/post/brownian-bridge-and-discrete-sampling/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Samsung Wireless Printer under Fedora 25</title>

      <description>This is a note for those who want to setup a Samsung wireless printer under Linux. It is quite simple, this forum post helped me, the actual useful steps on Fedora 25 are:
 download tar.gz linux driver from Samsung website. As root, unpack &amp;amp; install:
tar xvzf SamsungPrinterInstaller.tar.gz cd uld ./install.sh  in the printer menu, lookup for the wireless key (8 digits),
 connect to the printer Wifi network with a computer using the wireless key, <a href="/post/samsung_wireless_printer_fedora25/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.</p></description>

      <title>A new scheme for Heston - Part 2</title>

      <description>A couple weeks ago, I wrote about a new Heston discretisation scheme which was at least as accurate as Andersen QE scheme and faster, called DVSS2.
It turns out that it does not behave very well on the following Vanilla forward start option example (which is quite benign). The Heston parameters comes from a calibration to the market and are
$$v_0= 0.0718, \kappa= 1.542, \theta= 0.0762, \sigma= 0.582, \rho= -0. <a href="/post/a-new-scheme-for-heston_part2/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.</p></description>
