      <title>Numba, Pypy Overrated?</title>

      <description>Many benchmarks show impressive performance gains with the use of Numba or Pypy. Numba allows to compile just-in-time some specific methods, while Pypy takes the approach of compiling/optimizing the full python program: you use it just like the standard python runtime. From those benchmarks, I imagined that those tools would improve my 2D Heston PDE solver performance easily. The initialization part of my program contains embedded for loops over several 10Ks elements. <a href="/post/python-numba-overrated/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2018 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Fixing NaNs in Quadprog</title>

      <description>Out of curiosity, I tried quadprog as open-source quadratic programming convex optimizer, as it is looks fast, and the code stays relatively simple. I however stumbled on cases where the algorithm would return NaNs even though my inputs seemed straighforward. Other libraries such as CVXOPT did not have any issues with those inputs.
Searching on the web, I found that I was not the only one to stumble on this kind of issue with quadprog. <a href="/post/quadprog-nans/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2018 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>On the Probability of a Netflix Stock Crash</title>

      <description>This is a follow up to my previous post where I explore the probability of a TSLA stock crash, reproducing the results of Timothy Klassen.
According to the implied cumulative probability density, TSLA has around 15% chance of crashing below $100. Is this really high compared to other stocks? or is it the interpretation of the data erroneous?
Here I take a look at NFLX (Netflix). Below is the implied volatility according to three different models. <a href="/post/nflx-stock-crash-probability/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2018 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <description>Timothy Klassen had an interesting post on linkedin recently, with the title &amp;ldquo;the options market thinks there is a 16% chance that Tesla will not exist in January 2020&amp;rdquo;. As I was also recently looking at the TSLA options, I was a bit intrigued. I looked at the option chain on July 10th, and implied the European volatility from the American option prices. I then fit a few of my favorite models: Andreasen-Huge with Tikhonov regularization, the lognormal mixture, and a polynomial collocation of degree 7. <a href="/post/tsla-stock-crash-probability/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2018 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>The Fourth Moment of the Normal SABR Model</title>
      <link>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/normal-sabr-fourth-moment/</link>

      <description>I was wondering if I could use the SABR moments to calibrate a model to SABR parameters directly. It turns out that the SABR moments have relatively simple expressions when \(\beta=0\), that is, for the normal SABR model (with no absorption). This is for the pure SABR stochatic volatility model, not the Hagan approximation. For the Hagan approximation, we would need to use the replication by vanilla options to compute the moments. <a href="/post/normal-sabr-fourth-moment/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2018 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Implying the Probability Density from Market Option Prices (Part 2)</title>

      <description>This is a follow-up to my posts on the implied risk-neutral density (RND) of the SPW options before and after the big volatility change that happened in early February with two different techniques: a smoothing spline on the implied volatilities and a Gaussian kernel approach.
The Gaussian kernel (as well as to some extent the smoothing spline) let us believe that there are multiple modes in the distribution (multiple peaks in the density). <a href="/post/implying-the-probability-density-from-market-option-prices-ii/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2018 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Senior Developers Don&#39;t Know OO Anymore</title>

      <description>It has been a while since the good old object-oriented (OO) programming is not trendy anymore. Functional programming or more dynamic programming (Python-based) have been the trend, with an excursion in template based programming for C++ guys. Those are not strict categories: Python can be used in a very OO way, but it&amp;rsquo;s not how it is marketed or considered by the community.
Recently, I have seen some of the ugliest refactoring in my life as a programmer, done by someone with at least 10 years of experience programming in Java. <a href="/post/senior-developers-dont-know-oo-anymore/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2018 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <description>In the previous post, I showed a plot of the probability implied from SPW options before and after the big volatility change of last week. I created it from a least squares spline fit of the market mid implied volatilities (weighted by the inverse of the bid-ask spread). While it looks reasonable, the underlying technique is not very robust. It is particularly sensitive to the number of options strikes used as spline nodes. <a href="/post/implying-the-probability-density-from-market-option-prices/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2018 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <description>Yesterday the American stocks went a bit crazy along with the VIX that jumped from 17.50 to 38. It&amp;rsquo;s not exactly clear why, the news mention that the Fed might raise its interest rates, the bonds yield have been recently increasing substantially, and the market self-correcting after stocks grew steadily for months in a low VIX environment.
I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly follow the SPX/SPW options daily. But I had taken a snapshot two weeks ago when the market was quiet. <a href="/post/spx500_bets_after_rates_hike/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2018 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Discrete Sine Transform via the FFT</title>

      <description>Several months ago, I had a quick look at a recent paper describing how to use Wavelets to price options under stochastic volatility models with a known characteristic function. The more classic method is to use some numerical quadrature directly on the Fourier integral as described in this paper for example. When I read the paper, I was skeptical about the Wavelet approach, since it looked complicated, and with many additional parameters. <a href="/post/discrete_sine_transform_fft/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2018 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.
