      <description>I had the opportunity to receive a free book on climate change, through the company I am working for. I had not heard of that book before, it called Saving Us and is written by an actual climate scientist (Katharine Hayhoe). Unfortunately, written by does not mean that it is a scientific book, and it&amp;rsquo;s not. The author does not spend much effort explaining the physics or the reports, but focuses on how to convince people this is an important problem to tackle.</description>
