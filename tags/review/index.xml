      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to receive a free book on climate change, through the company I am working for. I had not heard of that book before, it called &lt;em&gt;Saving Us&lt;/em&gt; and is written by an actual climate scientist (Katharine Hayhoe).&#xA;Unfortunately, written by does not mean that it is a scientific book, and it&amp;rsquo;s not. The author does not spend much effort explaining the physics or the reports, but focuses on how to convince people this is an important problem to tackle. It is mildly interesting at first, as it presents the problem from a psychological angle. But it becomes quickly repetitive. The method is always the same, connect with what&amp;rsquo;s important to an audience who initially rejects climate warming (mostly the phenomenon, sometimes proposals around it), and make them understand that climate warming plays a role in their life, in the very matters they care about. It is presented as a series of personal experiences of the author, a list of examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
