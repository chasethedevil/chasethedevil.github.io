      <description>At a presentation of the Thalesians, Hagan has presented a new PDE based approach to compute arbitrage free prices under SABR. This is similar in spirit as Andreasen-Huge, but the PDE is directly on the density, not on the prices, and there is no one-step procedure: it&amp;rsquo;s just like a regular PDE with proper boundary conditions.
I was wondering how it compared to Andreasen Huge results.

My first implementation was quite slow. <a href="/post/sabr-with-the-new-hagan-pde-approach/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.</p></description>

      <description>The&amp;nbsp;MIT has a downloadable book on basic mathematics: Street Fighting Mathematics. I liked the part focused on the geometrical approach. It reminded me of the early greek mathematics.
Overall it does look like a very American approach to Maths: answering a multiple choices questions test by elimination. But it is still an interesting book. <a href="/post/street-fighting-mathematics-book/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.
