      <description>At a presentation of the Thalesians, Hagan has presented a new PDE based approach to compute arbitrage free prices under SABR. This is similar in spirit as Andreasen-Huge, but the PDE is directly on the density, not on the prices, and there is no one-step procedure: it&#39;s just like a regular PDE with proper boundary conditions.
I was wondering how it compared to Andreasen Huge results.

My first implementation was quite slow.</description>

      <description>TheÂ MIT has a downloadable book on basic mathematics: Street Fighting Mathematics. I liked the part focused on the geometrical approach. It reminded me of the early greek mathematics.Overall it does look like a very American approach to Maths: answering a multiple choices questions test by elimination. But it is still an interesting book.</description>
