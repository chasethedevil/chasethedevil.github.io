      <description>&lt;p&gt;My 12 years old child recently had a presentation to do with 3 other children for school, the subject was food and health.&#xA;It was particularly difficult to organize the children and one of the children came with a full presentation with text, generated by an LLM (possibly corrected by the parents).&#xA;At first, I thought this was just cheating and completly useless. Furthermore, he failed to read properly the details of the subject, and much of it wasn&amp;rsquo;t relevant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
