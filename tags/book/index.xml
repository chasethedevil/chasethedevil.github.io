      <title>Saving Us - Book Review</title>

      <description>I had the opportunity to receive a free book on climate change, through the company I am working for. I had not heard of that book before, it called Saving Us and is written by an actual climate scientist (Katharine Hayhoe). Unfortunately, written by does not mean that it is a scientific book, and it&amp;rsquo;s not. The author does not spend much effort explaining the physics or the reports, but focuses on how to convince people this is an important problem to tackle.</description>

      <title>My Review of Steven Koonin&#39;s Book on Climate</title>
      <link>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/koonin-on-climate-book-review/</link>

      <description>Steven Koonin, who was Secretary for Science, Department of Energy, in the Obama administration recently wrote a somewhat controversial book on climate science with the title Unsettled. I was curious to read what kind of critics a physicist who partly worked in the field had, even if I believe that climate warming is real, and humans have an influence on it. It turns out that some of his remarks regarding models are relevant way beyond climate science, but some other subjects are not as convincing.</description>

      <title>Disaster Capitalism - Summer Reading Review</title>
      <link>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/disaster-capitalism/</link>

      <description>Several years ago, I read the book No Logo from Naomi Klein. I did not find it particularly good, but it did raise a valid concern overall. This summer I read Shock Therapy - The rise of disaster capitalism. It suffers from some of the same flaws as No Logo, namely a lot of repetition of the same idea. Here, the underlying idea is that neoliberalism does not work in practice, and often ends up being some kind of corporatism.</description>

      <title>A review of Thomas Piketty - Le capital au XXI siecle</title>

      <description>I found back some old notes I had written about the book &amp;ldquo;Le capital au XXI siecle&amp;rdquo; from Thomas Piketty. It took me a while to finish that book last summer.&#xA;So many journalists have written around Piketty, that I had to buy the book and read it. It turns out that some of the criticism I have read is not really founded once one reads the book, but here are other real obvious criticisms that I suprisingly did not hear.</description>

      <title>Is Tufte overrated?</title>
      <link>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/is_tufte_overrated/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2016 16:11:30 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/is_tufte_overrated/</guid>
      <description>Tufte proposes interesting guidelines to present data, or even to design written semi-scientific papers or books. Some advices are particularly relevant like the careful use of colors (don&amp;rsquo;t use all the colors of the rainbow just because you can), and in general don&amp;rsquo;t add lines in a graph or designs that are not directly relevant to the message that needs to be conveyed. There is also a parallel with Feynman message against (Nasa) Powerpoint presentations.</description>

      <title>Option, Futures and Other Derivatives Book Review</title>

      <guid>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/option-futures-and-other-derivatives-book-review/</guid>
      <description>Option, Futures and Other Derivatives is by far the most popular book in finance. You will find it in every finance company, on many desks.&#xA;It is a very good introduction for people not familiar with standard financial products. This kind of book is unavoidable to understand the basis. It goes also beyond with the chapters on pricing and hedging. These 2 chapters make one understand many other book. If one understands the Black and Scholze formula, one can easily approach many other pricing formula, as in a way, there are all similar in their approach.</description>

      <title>Structured Equity Derivatives Book Review</title>

      <description>If one has to learn about equity derivatives, beside the classic Option, Futures and Other Derivatives from Hull, Structured Equity Derivatives by Harry M Kat is a must read.&#xA;His ideas are presented in a software developer friendly way, as his goal is to show how different equity derivatives products are behind the scenes, very similar.&#xA;I enjoyed the variety of exotic products presented and the very detailed way in which they are explained</description>

      <title>Java Concurrency In Practice Book Review</title>

      <guid>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/java-concurrency-in-practice-book-review/</guid>
      <description>My reference book on Java concurrency is Doug Lea&amp;#39;s Concurrent Programming in Java: Design Principles and Patterns. He is one of the authors of this new book, Java Concurrency In Practice. There is also Joshua Bloch, author of Effective Java, that many people love (but I am less a fan of it, even if I would recommend it to Java newbies), and author of Java Puzzlers, that I found more fun.</description>

      <title>Good Software Books - 2006 version</title>
      <link>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/good-software-books---2006-version/</link>

      <description>Here is an update of the most interesting software books I found interesting. I already made such a list in 2005:&#xA;Object Oriented Software Construction, 2nd Ed, by Bertrand Meyer. This made me understand why OOP is important, what is important in OOP and why it is still relevant. It contains lots of important guidelines you can apply to better design programs. One famous quote is &#34;Real systems have no top&#34;</description>

      <title>Algorithms in Java (Third Edition) Book Review</title>
      <link>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/algorithms-in-java-third-edition-book-review/</link>

      <guid>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/algorithms-in-java-third-edition-book-review/</guid>
      <description>The book Algorithms in Java is huge, but unlike the usual huge books, the content is very interesting. It can be used as reference material, or as toilet book (to learn things while you&#39;re wasting time in the toilets).&#xA;You will learn simple things, like what is the &#34;raison d&#39;Ãªtre&#34; of linked lists. The author gives very good examples to illustrate his propositions. He explains through the sieve of erathostene and through Josephus problem the advantages of arrays or linked list.</description>

      <title>SOA and B. Meyer</title>
      <link>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/soa-and-b.-meyer/</link>

      <guid>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/soa-and-b.-meyer/</guid>
      <description>While rereading parts of Object Oriented Software Construction from B. Meyer, I still find valuable information I overlooked. In the part about functional decomposition where he argues pro and cons of top-down / bottom-up approaches, he has the intuition of the current SOA hype. By showing that&#xA;Real systems have no top.&#xA;He suggests that the only way to build complex software is through a service oriented architecture. Of course SOA is a very old concept.</description>

      <title>Non Fiction Books (Mostly Software Programming) Before 2003</title>

      <description>A page with useful reference for me as I don&#39;t own each one of these books. It can provides you a very short review non-commercial biased.&#xA;2003&#xA;Programming Jakarta Struts (O&#39;Reilly - Chuck Cavaness) much better than Manning book. Explains struts very clearly with a more interesting example. Not enough on how to design your application for use with the evil ActionForm. Almost nothing on Struts 1.1 features. Nothing on common problems encountered while building web applications, or even about on how to design them using struts.</description>

      <title>Professional Portal Development Book Review</title>

      <description>I just finished reading Professional Portal Development With Open Source Tools (Wiley).&#xA;The Good:&#xA;I enjoyed Chapter 1, it gives a good presentation of Portlets for someone who does not know much about it. It is a chapter one can use as a reference to verify some specific details of how Portlets are working. It is a bit similar to JSR 168 specifications, but I found it more detailed and well written.</description>

      <description>A friend asked me for a list, here is it. I found those books the most interesting ones among those I have read about software in the past year or two:&#xA;Artificial Intelligence through Prolog, by Neil C. Rowe (Prentice-Hall): if you don&#39;t remember much about Prolog, it&#39;s a good book. It details how Prolog interpreters work. File Systems Forensic Analysis, by Brian Carrier (Addison Wesley): everything you need to know about disks and file systems, every trick to recover lost data.</description>

      <title>7 Years Later: Still EJBs</title>
      <link>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/7-years-later-still-ejbs/</link>

      <description>In 1998, a student of my school had a project with Sun about EJBs. This was the beginning of EJBs, they were not public, and there was no J2EE. At that time he found it utterly complicated, and had difficulties to understand why they made it so complicated.&#xA;In 2000, I worked for a company who had built in-house most components of a today J2EE application server. For example, they had their own unified messaging system, on the JSP side, they were already using custom tags, etc.</description>

      <title>Spring Books Roundup Updated</title>
      <link>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/spring-books-roundup-updated/</link>

      <description>I am completing my Spring Books Roundup with 2 new books:&#xA;Pro Spring, by Apress: a lengthy book, with some unnecessary information, but good overall. I did not like the Part 1, there is not much content in it. Fortunately, Part 2 is much better, dependency injection is very well described, almost on par, with the Fowler article of reference. Other Spring areas are well covered, in a similar manner as in Wrox book, except Java Server Faces, absent from the book, and nothing on Swing as well Spring Reference Documentation, from the springframework.</description>

      <title>Spring Books Roundup</title>

      <description>Spring is hip these days, so I decided to learn a bit more about it. I had used Avalon a while ago, I was attracted by its design by component and the way it seemed to lay out a proper infrastructure to build a server application. In the end, I was a bit disappointed, it required a bit too much glue code for my taste and did not provide that much in exchange.</description>

      <title>Java Puzzlers - Can you figure this out?</title>

      <description>The book Java Puzzlers is quite good. I don&#39;t think anyone can get every puzzle right. This shows again how you can very easily make someone fail interviews if you ask too silly questions. I suppose that if people were asking those questions they would not expect the right answers, but study the candidate reactions.&#xA;Here is a sample:&#xA;public class DosEquis {&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) {</description>

      <title>Is Prolog Better Suited Than SQL?</title>
      <link>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/is-prolog-better-suited-than-sql/</link>

      <guid>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/is-prolog-better-suited-than-sql/</guid>
      <description>I am currently reading a Prolog book Artificial Intelligence Through Prolog, I have been doing a bit of Prolog when I was very young and wanted to refresh my memory a bit. It is a very interesting read, especially when I take the viewpoint of our current application where no ACID compliance is required.&#xA;It seems to me that all the logic we coded to parametrize SQL queries and construct them dynamically could have been avoided if we had chosen Prolog as Prolog expressions would have been very natural to use in our project.</description>

      <title>Inside the Java Virtual Machine</title>

      <description>I am reading an old book, Inside the Java Virtual Machine. Some old books don&#39;t age, and this is one of them. The chapter on the Java Virtual Machine is just excellent and should be read by every Java developer. It explains each step a JVM does when you run a Java program, very clearly.&#xA;You could get plenty of stupid interview questions from it like: How is the Java stack used?</description>
