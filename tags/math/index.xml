      <description>I am on holiday today. Unfortunately I am still thinking about work-related matters, and out of curiosity, wanted to do a little experiment. I know it is not very good to spend free time on work related stuff: there is no reward for it, and there is so much more to life. Hopefully it will be over after this post.
Around 2 years ago, I saw a presentation from Andreasen and Huge about how they were able to price/calibrate SABR by a one-step finite difference technique.</description>

      <description>Where I work, there used to be quite a bit of a confusion on which rates one should use as input to a Local Volatility Monte-Carlo simulation.
In particular there is a paper in the Journal of Computation Finance by Andersen and Ratcliffe &amp;ldquo;The Equity Option Volatility Smile: a Finite Difference Approach&amp;rdquo; which explains one should use specially tailored rates for the finite difference scheme in order to reproduce exact Bond price and exact Forward contract prices</description>

      <title>Quasi Monte-Carlo &amp; Longstaff-Schwartz American Option price</title>

      <description>In the book Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering, Glasserman explains that if one reuses the paths used in the optimization procedure for the parameters of the exercise boundary (in this case the result of the regression in Longstaff-Schwartz method) to compute the Monte-Carlo mean value, we will introduce a bias: the estimate will be biased high because it will include knowledge about future paths.
However Longstaff and Schwartz seem to just reuse the paths in their paper, and Glasserman himself, when presenting Longstaff-Schwartz method later in the book just use the same paths for the regression and to compute the Monte-Carlo mean value.</description>

      <title>A Fast Exponential Function in Java</title>
      <link>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/a-fast-exponential-function-in-java/</link>

      <guid>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/a-fast-exponential-function-in-java/</guid>
      <description>In finance, because one often dicretize the log process instead of the direct process for Monte-Carlo simulation, the Math.exp function can be called a lot (millions of times for a simulation) and can be a bottleneck. I have noticed that the simpler Euler discretization was for local volatility Monte-Carlo around 30% faster, because it avoids the use of Math.exp.
Can we improve the speed of exp over the JDK one?</description>

      <title>Root finding in Lord Kahl Method to Compute Heston Call Price (Part II)</title>

      <description>In my previous post, I explored the Lord-Kahl methodto compute the call option prices under the Heston model. One of the advantages of this method is to go beyond machine epsilon accuracy and be able to compute very far out of the money prices or very short maturities. The standard methods to compute the Heston price are based on a sum/difference where both sides are far from 0 and will therefore be limited to less than machine epsilon accuracy even if the integration is very precise.</description>

      <description>I just tried to implement Lord Kahl algorithm to compute the Heston call price. The big difficulty of their method is to find the optimal alpha. That&amp;rsquo;s what make it work or break. The tricky part is that the function of alpha we want to minimize has multiple discontinuities (it&amp;rsquo;s periodic in some ways). This is why the authors rely on the computation of an alpha_max: bracketing is very important, otherwise your optimizer will jump the discontinuity without even noticing it, while you really want to stay in the region before the first discontinuity.</description>

      <description>Marsaglia in his paper on Normal Distributionmade the same mistake I initially did while trying to verify the accuracy of the normal density.In his table of values comparing the true value computed by Maple for some values of x to the values computed by Sun or Ooura erfc, he actually does not really use the same input for the comparison. One example is the last number: 16.6. 16.6 does not have an exact representation in double precision, even though it is displayed as 16.</description>

      <description>In my previous post, I stated that some library (SPECFUN by W.D. Cody) computes $$e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$$ the following way:xsq = fint(x * 1.6) / 1.6;del = (x - xsq) * (x + xsq);result = exp(-xsq * xsq * 0.5) * exp(-del Â 0.5);where fint(z) computes the floor of z.1. Why 1.6?An integer divided by 1.6 will be an exact representation of the corresponding number in double: 1.6 because of 16 (dividing by 1.</description>

      <description>Very interesting presentation from Murex about their GPU computing. Some points were:
 GPU demand for mostly exotics pricing and greeks Local vol main model for EQD exotics. Local vol calibrated via PDE approach. Markov functional model becoming main model for IRD. Use of local regression instead of Longstaff Schwartz (or worse CVA like sim of sim). philox RNG from DE Shaw. But the presenter does not seem to know RNGs very well (recommended Brownian Bridge for Mersenne Twister!</description>

      <description>How many reports have you had to fill up with a number of stars to choose? How much useless time is spent on figuring the this number just because it is always very ambiguous?
Some blogger wrote an interesting entry on Why I Hate Five Stars Reviews. Basically he advocates binary voting instead via like/dislike. Maybe a ternary system via like/dislike/don&#39;t care would be ok too.
One coworker used to advocate the same for a similar reason: people reading those reports only pay attention to the extremes: the 5 stars or the 0 stars.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Quadrature for Pricing European Option with Heston</title>

      <description>The Quantlib code to evaluate the Heston integral for European options is quite nice. It proposes Kahl &amp;amp; Jaeckel method as well as Gatheral method for the complex logarithm. It also contains expansions where it matters so that the resulting code is very robust. One minor issue is that it does not integrate both parts at the same time, and also does not propose Attari method for the Heston integral that is supposed to be more stable.</description>

      <title>Why primitive arrays matter in Java</title>

      <description>In the past, I have seen that one could greatly improve performance of some Monte-Carlo simulation by using as much as possible double[][] instead of arrays of objects.
It was interesting to read this blog post explaining why that happens: it is all about memory access.</description>

      <description>I have never really thought very much about generating random numbers according to a precise discrete distribution, for example to simulate an unfair dice. In finance, we are generally interested in continuous distributions, where there is typically 2 ways: the inverse transform (usually computed in a numerical way), and the acceptance-rejection method (typically the ziggurat. The inverse transform is often preferred, because it&amp;rsquo;s usable method for Quasi Monte-Carlo simulations while the acceptance rejection is not.</description>

      <description>Recently, I interviewed someone for a quant position. I was very surprised to find out that someone who did one of the best master in probabilities and finance in France could not solve a very basic probability problem:
This is accessible to someone with very little knowledge of probabilities When I asked this problem around to co-workers (who have all at least a master in a scientific subject), very few could actually answer it properly.</description>

      <description>I recently tried to minimise a function according to some constraints. One popular method to minimise a function in several dimensions is Nelder-Mead Simplex. It is quite simple, so simple that I programmed it in Java in 1h30, including a small design and a test. It helped that the original paper from Nelder-Mead is very clear:
However the main issue is that it works only for unconstrained problems. Nelder and Mead suggested to add a penalty, but in practice this does not work so well.</description>

      <title>SIMD and Mersenne-Twister</title>

      <description>Since 2007, there is a new kind of Mersenne-Twister (MT) that exploits SIMD architecture, the SFMT. The Mersenne-Twister has set quite a standard in random number generation for Monte-Carlo simulations, even though it has flaws.
I was wondering if SFMT improved the performance over MT for a Java implementation. There is actually on the same page a decent Java port of the original algorithm. When I ran it, it ended up slower by more than 20% than the classical Mersenne-Twister (32-bit) on a 64-bit JDK 1.</description>

      <title>The CUDA Performance Myth</title>

      <description>There is an interesting article on how to generate efficiently the inverse of the normal cumulative distribution on the GPU. This is useful for Monte-Carlo simulations based on normally distributed variables.
Another result of the paper is a method (breakless algorithm) to compute it apparently faster than the very good Wichura&amp;rsquo;s AS241 algorithm on the CPU as well keeping a similar precision. The key is to avoid branches (if-then) at the cost of not avoiding log() calls.</description>

      <description>A while ago, I was already looking for a good Java Matrix library, complaining that there does not seem any real good one where development is still active: the 2 best ones are in my opinion Jama and Colt.
Recently I tried to price options via RBF (radial basis functions) based on TR-BDF2 time stepping. This is a problem where one needs to do a few matrix multiplications and inverses (or better, LU solve) in a loop.</description>

      <description>Yes, I wrote an applet. I know it is very 1990s but, amazingly, it still does the job quite well. Ok, next time I should really use Flash to do this.

The Applet simulates Diffusion Limited Aggregation as described in Chaos And Fractals from Peitgen, Juergens, and Saupe. It represents ions randomly wandering around (in a Brownian motion) until they are caught by an attractive force in electrochemical deposition experiment.</description>

      <title>double[][] Is Fine</title>

      <description>In my previous post, I suggest that keeping a double[] performs better than keeping a double[][] if you do matrix multiplications and other operations.
This is actually not true. I benchmarked 3 libraries, Colt (uses double[]), Apache Commons Math (uses double[][]) and Jama (uses double[][] cleverly). At first it looks like Jama has a similar performance as Colt (they avoid [][] slow access by a clever algorithm). But once hotspot hits, the difference is crazy and Jama becomes the fastest (Far ahead).</description>
