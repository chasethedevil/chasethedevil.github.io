      <description>I moved my blog from blogger to Hugo. Blogger really did not evolve since Google take-over in 2003. Wordpress is today much nicer and prettier. It&amp;rsquo;s clear that Google did not invest at all, possibly because blogs are pass√©. Compared to mid 2000, there are very few blogs today. Even programming blogs are scarce. It could be interesting to quantify this. My theory is that it is the direct consequence of the popularity of social networks, and especially facebook (possibly also stackoverflow for programmers): people don&amp;rsquo;t have time anymore to write as their extra-time is used on social networks.</description>
