      <description>I temporarily abandonned Firefox for Chrome/Chromium. I am now back at using Firefox as Firefox 4 is as fast or faster than Chrome and seems more stable, especially under linux. Also it does not send anything to Google and there is bookmark sync independently of Google.
I am impressed that Mozilla managed to improve Firefox that much. <a href="/post/firefox-4-is-great/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.</p></description>

      <description>I have been a long user of Firefox, mostly thanks to the adblock extension. But recently, Firefox decided to change the way arrows work on the web pages, they don&amp;rsquo;t make the page scroll anymore. Meanwhile Chrome has now a good adblock plugin (that filters ads on load, not after load like it use to be) and is really much much faster than Firefox. So there is no more reason not to use it. <a href="/post/bye-bye-firefox/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.
