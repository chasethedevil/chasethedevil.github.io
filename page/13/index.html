Peter Jaeckel, in a <a href="http://www.pjaeckel.webspace.virginmedia.com/ClampingDownOnArbitrage.pdf">recent paper (pdf)</a>, shows that something that sounds like a reasonable arbitrage free interpolation can produce wiggles in the implied volatility slice.<br /><br />The interpolation in question is using some convexity preserving spline on call and put option prices directly and in strike, assuming those input prices are arbitrage free. This is very similar to <a href="http://nkahale.free.fr/papers/Interpolation.pdf">Kahale interpolation (pdf)</a>.<br /><br />It seemed too crazy for me so I had to try out his example. And using a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2175002">harmonic spline</a>, it does produce arbitrage free wiggles.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HhHvYhvdlwU/UxSkNCTJiXI/AAAAAAAAHBQ/buAU6Q_wALM/s1600/Screenshot+from+2014-03-03+16:29:29.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HhHvYhvdlwU/UxSkNCTJiXI/AAAAAAAAHBQ/buAU6Q_wALM/s1600/Screenshot+from+2014-03-03+16:29:29.png" height="297" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Wiggles in the implied volatility</td></tr></tbody></table>If we look at the probability density (the curvature), the Harmonic spline maintains a positive density, nearly piecewise flat in log scale, while Hyman, because it preserves only monotonicity, has some negative density which are cut out from the graph.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UKuoXUcVRYY/UxSk1ylZ7jI/AAAAAAAAHBY/RDxMR2Q69GY/s1600/Screenshot+from+2014-03-03+16:47:46.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UKuoXUcVRYY/UxSk1ylZ7jI/AAAAAAAAHBY/RDxMR2Q69GY/s1600/Screenshot+from+2014-03-03+16:47:46.png" height="297" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Probability Density</td></tr></tbody></table>In reality, if we look at the interpolation of prices in log scale, one can see that splines won't behave as expected at first on small numbers: they will give a much higher weight to the high values, producing something like a piecewise linear interpolation.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5WOPPmW088c/UxSml6PGWmI/AAAAAAAAHBk/xOfiaaRcpLI/s1600/Screenshot+from+2014-03-03+16:57:33.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5WOPPmW088c/UxSml6PGWmI/AAAAAAAAHBk/xOfiaaRcpLI/s1600/Screenshot+from+2014-03-03+16:57:33.png" height="297" width="400" /></a></div><br />In reality, what one really wants for such data is to just interpolate the log prices with a spline, not the prices. This is the curve named "Log" in the graphs, where a simple cubic spline is used on the log prices, and fed to exp after interpolation.<br /><br />Now it sounds like a reasonable arbitrage free interpolation would be to interpolate the discrete density log linearly, in a similar spirit as <a href="http://finmod.co.za/interpreview.pdf">Hagan-West yield curve interpolation</a> (pdf).<br /><br />In general, if you interpolate very small numbers with a spline, you probably are doing something wrong.

  <p>In an earlier post, I have been quickly exploring <!-- raw HTML omitted -->adjoint differentiation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the context of analytical Black-Scholes. Today, I tried to mix it in a simple Black-Scholes Monte-Carlo as described in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->L. Capriotti paper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and measured the performance to compute delta compared to a numerical single sided finite difference delta.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was a bit surprised that even on a single underlying, without any real optimization, adjoint delta was faster by a factor of nearly 40%. I suspect this is mostly due to exp evaluations being /2.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On a basket of 4 assets, the adjoint method was 3.25x faster.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s quick to have such results on basic payoffs: it took me a few hours and worked on the first run, even though my Monte-Carlo is slightly different from the Capriotti paper. It is much more challenging to have it working across a wide variety of payoffs, and to automatize some of it.</p>

Several papers show that the limit for large strikes of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDUQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1002.3633&amp;ei=GjUGU5uVIeu00wXEwoCwBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHvnJ9xYAv60R4GSUbMORRI9_-7Zg&amp;sig2=iqplpcXauJBLJ9DIw71vWA&amp;bvm=bv.61725948,d.d2k">Heston is SVI</a>.<br /><br />Interestingly, I stumbled onto a surface where the Hagan SABR fit was perfect as well as the SVI fit, while the Heston fit was not.<br /><br />Originally, I knew that, on this data, the SVI fit was perfect. Until today, I just never tried to fit a lognormal SABR on the same data. I did a small test with random values of the SABR parameters alpha, rho, nu, and found out that in deed, the SVI fit is always perfect on SABR.<br /><br />Is this just because the Taylor expansion of SVI will match the Taylor expansion of SABR up to the fourth order? It seems that the wings are also not too far off in general so there could be more to it.<br /><br />Gatheral actually devised an SVI formula that uses SABR like variables <a href="http://mfe.baruch.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/OsakaSVI2012.pdf">in a talk here</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QNLwJnVGPUE/UwY9EwCkZ6I/AAAAAAAAHA4/DP6MstmUqg4/s1600/Screenshot+from+2014-02-20+18:36:06.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QNLwJnVGPUE/UwY9EwCkZ6I/AAAAAAAAHA4/DP6MstmUqg4/s1600/Screenshot+from+2014-02-20+18:36:06.png" height="79" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Of course, the reverse is not true. SVI has more parameters and provides in general a better fit than SABR.

  <p>With a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->small time expansion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, it is easy to derive a reasonable initial guess, without resorting to some global minimizer.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Forde &amp; al did for Heston<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, one can find the 5 Schobel-Zhu parameters through 5 points at coordinates (0,0), (x0,t1), (-x0,t1), (x0,t2), (-x0,t2), where x0 is a chosen the log-moneyness, for example, 0.1 and t1, t2 relatively short expiries (for example, 0.1, 0.25).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We can truncate the small time expansion so that the polynomial in (x,t) is fully captured by those 5 points. In practice, I have noticed that using a more refined expansion with more terms resulted not only in more complex formulas to lookup the original stochastic volatility parameters, but also in an increased error, because of the redundancy of parameters in the polynomial expansion.

  <p>Small time expansions for Heston can be useful during the calibration of the implied volatility surface, in order to find an initial guess for a local minimizer (for example, Levenberg-Marquardt). Even if they are not so accurate, they capture the dynamic of the model parameters, and that is often enough.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In 2011, Forde et al. proposed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a second order small time expansion<!-- raw HTML omitted --> around the money, which I found to work well for calibration. More recently, Lorig et al. proposed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->different expansions up to order-3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> around the money. I already looked at the later in my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->previous post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, applying the idea to Schobel-Zhu.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I noticed, however, that on some surfaces, the Lorig expansion was quickly very inaccurate (LPP1 for order-1, LPP2 for order-2, LPP3 for order-3). Those surfaces seem to be the ones were the Feller condition is largely violated. In practice, in my set of volatility surfaces for 10 different equities/indices, the best fit is always produced by Heston parameters where the Feller condition is violated.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->T=0.5, Feller condition largely violated<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->T=0.5, Feller condition slightly violated<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Out of curiosity, I calibrated my surfaces feeding the order-1 approximation to the differential evolution, in order to find my initial guess, and it worked for all surfaces.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The order-3 formula, even though it is more precise at the money, was actually more problematic for calibration: it failed to find a good enough initial guess in some cases, maybe because the reference data should be truncated, to possibly keep the few shortest expiries, and close to ATM strikes.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

  <p>Last week, my work laptop died after spilling out some water on its keyboard inadvertently. Fortunately, its SSD was intact.</p>
<p>As the laptop SSD connector (SATA) and power follow the desktop computers standards, and as I use Linux, I just plugged the SSD to my home desktop and booted off the SSD. I had to change slightly the X configuration but otherwise everything worked. Linux is great for that</p>
<p>The same way, I just plugged the SSD to the desktop at work and it worked. Instead of carrying a laptop, I carry now my small and ultra-light SSD.</p>
<p>The experience is so good, that it seems to me it should be an option to everybody. Before, hard drives were very sensitive to travel, but now with SSDs, I don&rsquo;t really see why we should carry a screen and a keyboard unless we use them (for example in a travel). Also I find that I actually notice the speed difference between my desktops and former laptop, which I never really paid too much attention to before.</p>

At first I did not make use of the Brownian Bridge technique in Heston QMC, because the variance process is not simulated like a Brownian Motion under the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.javaquant.net/papers/LeifAndersenHeston.pdf&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=p9jjUtPJK8uUhQfb_YGgAw&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;sig2=EjKPr39tR0ni1vq5gK9mkA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQyqSaDu2kl6_KpP-s-KwMvJ6hPg">Quadratic Exponential algorithm from Andersen</a>.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kWmb0WWAYzA/UuPX4UMySRI/AAAAAAAAG-4/cBcjRgfTc5s/s1600/Screenshot+from+2014-01-25+16:26:05.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kWmb0WWAYzA/UuPX4UMySRI/AAAAAAAAG-4/cBcjRgfTc5s/s1600/Screenshot+from+2014-01-25+16:26:05.png" /></a></div><br />It is, however, perfectly possible to use the Brownian Bridge on the asset process. Does it make a difference? In my small test, it does not seem to make a difference. An additional question would be, is it better to take first N for the asset and next N for the variance or vice versa or intertwined? Intertwined would seem the most natural (this is what I used without Brownian Bridge, but for simplicity I did Brownian bridge on first N).<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WN5frRWHix4/UuKyR69BtbI/AAAAAAAAG-g/BTXm5K2XOQo/s1600/heston_bnp_sobol2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WN5frRWHix4/UuKyR69BtbI/AAAAAAAAG-g/BTXm5K2XOQo/s1600/heston_bnp_sobol2.png" height="222" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />By contrast, Schobel-Zhu QE scheme can make full use of the Brownian Bridge technique, in the asset process as well as in the variance process. Here is a summary of the volatility process under the QE scheme from <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi%3Ffid%3D99534&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=itjjUo2jD6Wa0AXqzYHgCQ&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;sig2=KdYdo3sAFjV6fwPS4Gak0A&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZ8DRGCf4EXOxCXs3oPc_98628hA">van Haastrecht</a>:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kYpBO8PfEkw/UuPX_40DnbI/AAAAAAAAG_A/v7QAN_lX9oM/s1600/Screenshot+from+2014-01-25+16:26:23.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kYpBO8PfEkw/UuPX_40DnbI/AAAAAAAAG_A/v7QAN_lX9oM/s1600/Screenshot+from+2014-01-25+16:26:23.png" /></a></div><br />Another nice property of Schobel-Zhu is that the QE simulation is as fast as Euler, and therefore 2.5x faster than the Heston QE.<br /><br />I calibrated the model to the same surface, and the QMC price of a ATM call option seems to have a similar accuracy as Heston QMC. But we can see that the Brownian Bridge does increase accuracy in this case. I was surprised that accuracy was not much better than Heston, but maybe it is because I did yet not implement the Martingale correction, while I did so in the Heston case.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--mK4u1K8nOk/UuKyR2y6FHI/AAAAAAAAG-k/QSOjDwosqLo/s1600/sz_bnp_sobol3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--mK4u1K8nOk/UuKyR2y6FHI/AAAAAAAAG-k/QSOjDwosqLo/s1600/sz_bnp_sobol3.png" height="222" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation">Adjoint algorithmic differentiation</a> is particularly interesting in finance as we often encounter the case of a function that takes many input (the market data) and returns one output (the price) and we would like to also compute sensitivities (greeks) to each input.<br /><br />As I am just starting around it, to get a better grasp, I first tried to apply the idea to the analytic knock out barrier option formula, by hand, only to find out I was making way too many errors by hand to verify anything. So I tried the simpler vanilla Black-Scholes formula. I also made various errors, but managed to fix all of them relatively easily.<br /><br />I decided to compare how much time it took to compute price, delta, vega, theta, rho, rho2 between single sided finite difference and the adjoint approach. Here are the results for 1 million options:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">FD time=2.13s<br />Adjoint time=0.63s</blockquote><br /><b>It works well</b>, but doing it by hand is crazy and too error prone. It might be simpler for Monte-Carlo payoffs however.<br /><br />There are not many Java tools that can do reverse automatic differentiation, I found <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CFAQFjAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcluster.grid.pub.ro%2Fwiki%2Findex.php%2FADiJaC_-_Automatic_Differentiation_of_Java_Classfiles&amp;ei=SmDeUtDLCYrG0QWrlIHQDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHLMwobO6u5jSoUifCdHvE2yPZ6oQ&amp;sig2=wFbGRYjgLenCNGRbrQ1gKQ&amp;bvm=bv.59568121,d.d2k">some thesis</a> on it, with an interesting byte code oriented approach (one difficulty is that you need to reverse loops, while statements).

Pooley et al., in <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~paforsyt/report.pdf">Convergence Remedies for non-smooth payoffs in option pricing</a> suggest that placing the strike on the grid for a Vanilla option is good enough:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CIS-yTdMn7k/UtKy6HtMIhI/AAAAAAAAG-I/Hef_w7gTcJ0/s1600/pooley_vanilla_smooth.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CIS-yTdMn7k/UtKy6HtMIhI/AAAAAAAAG-I/Hef_w7gTcJ0/s1600/pooley_vanilla_smooth.png" height="48" width="640" /></a></div><br />At the same time, Tavella and Randall show in their book that numerically, placing the strike in the middle of two nodes leads to a more accurate result. My own numerical experiments confirm Tavella and Randall suggestion.<br /><br />In reality, what Pooley et al. really mean, is that quadratic convergence is maintained if the strike is on the grid for vanilla payoffs, contrary to the case of discontinuous payoffs (like digital options) where the convergence decreases to order 1. So it's ok to place the strike on the grid for a vanilla payoff, but it's not optimal, it's still better to place it in the middle of two nodes. Here are absolute errors in a put option price:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">on grid, no smoothing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.04473021824995271</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">on grid, Simpson smoothing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.003942854282069419<br />on grid, projection smoothing 0.044730218065351934<br />middle, no smoothing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.004040359609906119</span><br /><br />As expected (and mentioned in Pooley et al.), the projection does not do anything here. When the grid size is doubled, the convergence ratio of all methods is the same (order 2), but placing the strike in the middle still increases accuracy significantly.<br /><br />Here is are the same results, but for a digital put option:<br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">on grid, no smoothing &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.03781319921461046<br />on grid, Simpson smoothing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.289052335705427E-4<br />on grid, projection smoothing 1.9698293587372406E-4<br />middle, no smoothing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.5122153011418744E-4</span><br /><br />Here only the 3 last methods are of order-2 convergence, and projection is in deed the most accurate method, but placing the strike in the middle is really not that much worse, and much simpler.<br /><br />A disadvantage of Simpson smoothing (or smoothing by averaging), is that it breaks put-call parity (see the paper "<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2362969">Exact Forward and Put Call Parity with TR-BDF2</a>") <br /><br />I think the emphasis in their paper on "no smoothing is required" for vanilla payoffs can be misleading. I hope I have clarified it in this post.
