  <p>There are some open source projects that can help you in generating or reading RSS feeds in Java. I found only two libraries a bit mature, other code is often embedded in other open source products (jroller for example):<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->    <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Informa<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Does various RSS formats and Atom 0.3. Documentation is better than its alternative, but less focused (has some hibernate helper thingy, some lucene helper, etc.).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sandler<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: There is no working homepage while I am writing this. But the code is of decent quality, supports Atom 0.3 and RSS 1.0. It is easy to use it. However in reality it is not much more than a wrapper around some XML parser specialized in generating an RSS structure or an Atom structure.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ooops, I forgot another important one, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rome<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This RSS/Atom framework with a catchy name is very similar to Informa, has good documentation and good looking code. Under the hood it makes use of jdom.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> I personally use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->dom4j<!-- raw HTML omitted --> since I only need to generate RSS, and RSS, or Atom are just XML. I don&rsquo;t find it particularly verbose to use dom4j for that, and it is very flexible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you need to parse feeds, then those libraries might make sense and save you a bit of time. For generating, I think their main interest is to abstract you from the differences in formats. So if you need to handle different formats, a framework will allow you to do it through only one API, which can be a big time-saver.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Categories: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->java<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rss<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->atom<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

  <p>I was writing an Atom feed generator for my current project. I chosed to support <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Atom 1.0<!-- raw HTML omitted --> since it looks like it has the capabilities to establish as the next standard. Unfortunately I quickly saw that it was quite hard to test it in the real world (out of the good feedvalidator), as almost nobody seems to accept Atom 1.0 feeds yet, even if it is rapidely changing (there is support for it in Firefox CVS version).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I decided to support RSS as well, the big question was: which RSS version? After grabbing lots of info on the subject, I opted for 1.0 again (more flexible, more different than Atom). It was actually quick to support RSS, but then when in real world, neither <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Desktop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> nor <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My Yahoo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was willing to accept my feed. I looked at every bit of my xml, fiddled with Tomcat configuration in any possible way when I saw that no request was coming to my server from Yahoo or Google. And finally I thought, hmm maybe it&rsquo;s the port. I restarted my server on port 80, and yup, it worked!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wonder why Google Desktop and My Yahoo don&rsquo;t support another port than port 80 for RSS feeds.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->tags: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Categories: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->atom<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rss<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gdesktop<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->syndication<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

  <time datetime="2005-08-25T14:35:00Z" class="post-date">Thu, Aug 25, 2005</time>
  <p>I like the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Desktop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with the sidebar. It shares similarities with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Konfabulator<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, recently bought by yahoo. They both allow easy access to some custom little widgets that I would call &ldquo;active&rdquo;. They are active because they are refreshed periodically with new information (processor usage, news, scratch pad, emails, etc). But while Konfabulator choose to emphasize on visual effects, Google prefers a more standard information presentation. This shows as well in their choice of technologies:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Sidebar plug-ins are just Windows appz that can take advantage of Google Interfaces. That makes them quite powerful in theory, but programming them is less accessible.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Konfabulator plug-ins are Javascript+XML, the Javascript is not just regular client-side javascript, it can use Konfabulator API (containing many effect and rudimentary network access), and COM objects . That makes them very focused on presentation, and the Internet.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> In the long run, Google choice makes sense, the forthcoming <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Avalon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will make visual effects very accessible to windows developers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now back to the subject, I missed the &lsquo;activation on hotkey&rsquo; feature from Konfabulator for the Google Sidebar. Fortunately, I a have found a powerful little open-source program, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Autohotkey<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that allowed me to do that very quickly. Here is the script I use (it&rsquo;s a hack since it relies on toolbar size (but not position), but I like the default position and it works (only using floating deskbar, i let you figure out for the non floating version)):<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->F12::<!-- raw HTML omitted -->MouseGetPos, X, Y<!-- raw HTML omitted -->if WinExist(&ldquo;ahk_class _GD_Sidebar&rdquo;)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->{<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    WinActivate<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    BlockInput,On<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    MouseClick, left, 160, 16<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    MouseMove, X,Y<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    BlockInput,Off<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    return<!-- raw HTML omitted -->}<!-- raw HTML omitted -->else if WinExist(&ldquo;ahk_class ATL:0044A4C8&rdquo;)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->{<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    WinActivate<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    BlockInput,On<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    MouseClick, left,  158,  16<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    MouseMove, X,Y<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    BlockInput,Off<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    return<!-- raw HTML omitted -->}<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Categories: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->google<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->desktop<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sidebar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hotkey<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->autohotkey<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hack<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

  <time datetime="2005-08-23T19:37:00Z" class="post-date">Tue, Aug 23, 2005</time>
  <p>I am currently facing a problem that neither <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hibernate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> nor <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iBatis<!-- raw HTML omitted --> solves nicely. I also looked at other ORM or just DB framework, without success. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> What I would need is a framework that generates PreparedStatements with a query by Criteria like API. I have many queries that are similar but varying according to different input parameters. iBatis can handle this, but for complex queries and scenarios, the XML becomes completely unreadable, and you therefore loose any advantage that iBatis was bringing with the externalization of SQL statements in XML. The other issue I have with using iBatis is that for another part of my project, the automatic generation of SQL statements a-la Hibernate is useful.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Hibernate has a very nice <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Query by Criteria<!-- raw HTML omitted --> API, but it lacks just a tiny bit of flexibility in customizing queries. For example, I could not find a way to specify a &ldquo;USE INDEX(index_name)&rdquo; in the generated SQL, after the SELECT FROM xxx and before the rest of the query. I did not find either a way to specify the use of a &ldquo;STRAIGHT_JOIN&rdquo; instead of an INNER JOIN. These are all MySQL specific issues, but those little things are extremely useful at improving some of my queries performances. Writing N sql queries hard coded is not a good option, since this N can be quite big, which is why I am using Query by Criteria in the first place.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> So is there a need for yet another DB framework?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

  <p>When I bookmark articles with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->delicious<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I like to keep the content on my hard drive, because pages sometimes change, or are removed, or I want to do local searches. I believe this is one reason some people like furl (furl keeps a copy on their server that only yourself can read, but does not allow search).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A combination of slogger and delicious could solve partially the problem. But it is not integrated, I can&rsquo;t get my local version from delicious, so I loose the tagging, listing and all other plus from delicious.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I added my own feature to the delicious toolbar, which I like very much.

The chapter on the Java Virtual Machine is just excellent and should be read by every Java developer. It explains each step a JVM does when you run a Java program, very clearly.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You could get plenty of stupid interview questions from it like: How is the Java stack used? Between method area, heap, pc register, stack which one are shared among threads?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also they saw the full potential of Java quite early on (1997). They explain how the JVM specs allow for very different implementations, ones that can run in different environments, for example, simplifying a bit: low memory, embedded world, or lots of memory, mainframe world. It is not an accident if Microsoft chosed a very similar design for the CLI of .NET, they have been looking for getting into the embedded area for quite some time, and apparently, they are making good progress.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tags: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->java<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->programming<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->book<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->review<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

  <p>I have been doing some work on Firefox extensions. Mozilla/Firefox is a really interesting world, it is extremely flexible, you can make it transform the web the way you want.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Recently, someone started <!-- raw HTML omitted -->YubNub<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the &ldquo;command line for the web&rdquo;, a very simple idea, but useful. This is a bit similar to the Firefox Search Bar, except more powerful, and quicker to use. Mozilla developers actually had that idea a long time ago (around 2000), it is called shortcut url. Basically to any bookmark, you can add a shortcut, you then just have to type that shortcut (let say g for google.com) in the address bar to go to the address pointed by the shortcut. This shortcut accepts 1 parameter (represented by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->%s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the URL), so you can do &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->g chasethedevil<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; to search google for &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->chasethedevil<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; if you set up your shortcut properly. Firefox can build this dynamic URL automatically for you if in an input box, you right click and choose &ldquo;Add a keyword for this search&rdquo;.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Now we have seen the Firefox address bar can be used to quickly perform a search on a selected website. But this can be much more powerful. As <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this<!-- raw HTML omitted --> page suggests, you can associate a bookmarklet with a shortcut, you can execute whatever javascript you wish. One very simple example is: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->javascript:void(location.href=<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lsquo;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/">http://web.archive.org/web/</a>*dc_/'+location.href)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This shows how you can use the address bar in a very flexible manner. It would be easy to support a multiple parameters search using a bookmarklet. There is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a whole list<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of commands very similar to yubnub ones in addition to those on the previously mentioned link.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> I first thought about writing a simple extension to have my command line in Firefox (for example by extending the getShortcutOnURI function), but after some information gathering, I discovered it was already possible. Firefox is truly amazing. It is a bit of a shame that this functionality is not a bit better exposed to the user.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tags: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firefox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->shortcut<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extension<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bookmarklet<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

  <p>I have been doing some Ruby On Rails, for 2 small projects. While I think it is good, I think it is overhyped as well. It is well designed, has good ideas (easy configuration), and focus on the right problem, architecture. But my conclusion is that I am not more productive with it than with Java.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> I think most of the development time is not spent coding, but thinking. It is a very obvious statement, and yet too often ignored.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->current Joel On Software article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is just making my point: if you look at how much time it took the students to complete their program, you can see it is not the writing that took that much time. And I am sure you noticed the same on your own projects.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> So all the nice features of the Ruby language don&rsquo;t save you a lot of time. And actually when your code size is growing, it becomes increasingly difficult for an outsider to understand your program. Everything can be so dynamic, and your only help is a syntax coloring editor. Compare that to Eclipse, or IDEA, or Netbeans, where you have very convenient search, not text search, but search for declarations, for calls, of methods, variables, classes, all that just a mouse click away. Strong typing goes a little bit in the way while writing, but helps understanding better in many cases (personally I wish Java had type inference, as all the verbosity is not always needed). And when if you really want less verbosity, then you have access to a handful of JVM languages.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> A drawback of Java is maybe that you have access to too many libraries. Sometimes, making a choice among the bazaar is not easy and the hype gets scattered.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tags: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->java<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->programming<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ruby<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
