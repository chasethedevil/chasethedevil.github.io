  </h1>
  <time datetime="2014-05-20T12:08:00Z" class="post-date">Tue, May 20, 2014</time>
  <p>While playing around with <a href="/post/good--popular-algorithms-are-simple/">differential evolution</a> to calibrate SABR, I noticed that sometimes, several set of parameters can lead to a very similar smile, usually the good one is for relatively low vol of vol and the bad one is for relatively high vol of vol. I first looked for errors in my implementation, but it&rsquo;s a real phenomenon.

</figure>
</p>
<p>I used the normal implied volatility formula with beta=1, then converted it to lognormal (Black) volatility. While it might not be a great idea to rely on the normal formula with beta=1, I noticed the same phenomenon with the <a href="/post/sabr-with-new-hagan-pde-approach">arbitrage free PDE density approach</a>, especially for long maturities. Interestingly, I did not notice such behavior before with other stochastic volatility models like Heston or Schobel-Zhu: I suspect it has to do with the approximations rather than with the true behavior of SABR.</p>
<p>Differential evolution is surprisingly good at finding the global minimum without much initial knowledge, however when there are close fits like this it can be more problematic, usually this requires pushing the population size up. I find that differential evolution is a neat way to test the robustness (as well as performance) of different SABR algorithms as it will try many crazy sets.</p>
<p>In practice, for real world calibration, there is not much use of differential evolution to calibrate SABR as it is relatively simple to find a good initial guess.</p>

  <time datetime="2014-05-15T22:06:00Z" class="post-date">Thu, May 15, 2014</time>
  <p>Some people use <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpapers.ssrn.com%2Fsol3%2Fpapers.cfm%3Fabstract_id%3D1496982&amp;ei=nx11U6QOoozQBcrfgIAK&amp;usg=AFQjCNHi149E0_JiOzZRT9kgDWWYvHWlFQ&amp;sig2=ZnhySOuJd8V-jBcWo4Ky2w&amp;bvm=bv.66699033,d.d2k">Heston to fit one slice</a> of a volatility surface. In this case, some parameters are clearly redundant. Still, I was wondering how it fared against SABR, which is always used to fit a slice. And what about Schobel-Zhu?
<figure><img src="/post/Screenshot%20from%202014-05-15%2021%2020%2028.png"><figcaption>
      <h4>Aggregated error in fit per slice on 10 surfaces</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>With Heston, the calibration is actually slightly better with kappa=0, that is, without mean reversion, because the global optimization is easier and the mean reversion is fully redundant. It&rsquo;s still quite remarkable that 3 parameters result in a fit as good as 5 parameters.</p>
<p>This is however not the case for Schobel-Zhu, where each &ldquo;redundant parameter&rdquo; seem to make a slight difference in the quality of calibration. kappa = 0 deteriorate a little bit the fit (the mean error is clearly higher), and theta near 0 (so calibrating 4 parameters) is also a little worse (although better than kappa = 0). Also interestingly, the five parameters Schobel-Zhu fit is slightly better than Heston, but not so when one reduce the number of free parameters.</p>
<p>So what about Heston vs SABR. It is interesting to consider the case of general Beta and Beta=1: it turns out that as confirmed for equities, beta=1 is actually a better choice.
<figure><img src="/post/Screenshot%20from%202014-05-15%2021%2034%2049.png"><figcaption>
      <h4>Aggregated error in fit per slice on 10 surfaces</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>Overall on my 10 surfaces composed each of around 10 slices, an admittedly small sample, Heston (without mean-reversion) fit is a little bit better than SABR. Also the <a href="/post/svi-on-top-of-sabr">SVI-SABR</a> idea from Gatheral is not great: the fit is clearly worse than SABR with Beta=1 and even worse than a simple quadratic.
Of course the best overall fit is achieved with the classic SVI, because it has 6 parameters while the others have only 3.</p>
<p>All the calibrations so far were done slice by slice independently, using levenberg marquardt on an initial guess found by differential evolution. Some people advocate for speed or stability of parameters reasons the idea of calibrating each slice using the previous slice as initial guess with a local optimizer like levenberg marquardt, in a bootstrapping fashion.
<figure><img src="/post/Screenshot%20from%202014-05-15%2021%2051%2018.png">
</figure>
</p>
<p>The results can be quite different, especially for SVI, which then becomes the worst, even worse than SVI-SABR, which is actually a subset of SVI with fewer parameters. How can this be?</p>
<p>This is because as the number of parameters increases, the first slices optimizations have a disproportionate influence, and finding the real minimum is much more difficult, even with differential evolution for the first slice. It&rsquo;s easy to picture that you&rsquo;ll have much more chances to get stuck in some local minimum. It&rsquo;s interesting to note that the real stochastic volatility models are actually better behaved in this regard, but I am not so sure that this kind of calibration is such a great idea in general.</p>
<p>In practice, the SVI parameters fitted independently evolve in a given surface on each slice in a smooth manner, mostly monotonically. It&rsquo;s just that to go from one set on one slice to the other on the next slice, you might have to do something more than a local optimization.</p>

    <a href="https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/quadratic-spline-with-knots-at-mid-points/">Quadratic Spline with Knots at Mid-Points</a>
  </h1>
  <time datetime="2014-05-14T14:12:00Z" class="post-date">Wed, May 14, 2014</time>
  <p>Two months ago, I looked at <a href="/post/arbitrage-free-interpolation-of-option-prices-using-piecewise-constant-density">arbitrage free interpolation using piecewise-constant density</a>. This is equivalent to a piecewise quadratic polynomial in call prices where each piece is centered around each call strike.</p>
<p>I wondered at the time what a quadratic spline would look like on this problem, as it should be very close in theory, except that we can ensure that it is C1, a condition for a good looking implied volatility.</p>
<p>For a while, I did not find any references around splines where knots are in between two interpolation points and derived my own formula. And then I lost the paper, but out of curiosity, I looked at the excellent De Boor book &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Splines-Applied-Mathematical-Sciences/dp/0387953663">A Practical Guide to Splines</a>&rdquo; and found that there was actually a chapter around this: quadratic splines with knots at mid-points. Interestingly, it turns out that a quadratic spline on standard knots is not always well defined, which is why, if one does quadratic splines, the knots need to be moved.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The papers from this era are quite rudimentary in their presentation (the book is much better). I found the paper from Demko 1977 &ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fpii%2F0021904578900904&amp;ei=oldzU8i0EsTY0QX3xIH4Bg&amp;usg=AFQjCNH8gbNKzPTyFH3xI-FDPJZIAFJAbg&amp;sig2=5fGbnp0Kaf3fx-KZDf5AiA&amp;bvm=bv.66699033,d.d2k">Interpolation by Quadratic Splines</a>&rdquo; quite usable for coding. I adjusted the boundaries to make the first and last quadratic fit the first two/last two strikes (adding a first strike at 0 and a large last strike if necessary) and spend countless time worrying about indices. The result on a simple classic example is interesting.

<p>On the non monotonic discrete density data of my earlier blog entry, this gives:

      <h4>QSpline is the quadratic spline</h4>

</figure>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, interpolating small prices with such a spline results in a highly oscillating interpolation: this is the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021904591900348">Gibbs phenomenon for splines</a>. We need to loose strict C1 continuity for practical applications, and use a first derivative approximation instead, very much like the Harmonic cubic spline.

  </h1>
  <time datetime="2014-04-23T17:18:00Z" class="post-date">Wed, Apr 23, 2014</time>
  <p>I am going to write a little about my experience and conclusions so far around interviewing a candidate for a software developer position or for a quant position, but it should be quite general.</p>
<p>At first, I used to ask interview questions I liked when I was myself a candidate. On the technical side, it would stuff like:</p>
<ul>
<li>which design patterns do you know?</li>
<li>what&rsquo;s your opinion on design patterns?&lt;</li>
<li>what&rsquo;s a virtual method?</li>
<li>any interesting algorithm you like?</li>
<li>which libraries did you use?</li>
</ul>
<p>For a quant type I&rsquo;d ask more specific questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>what&rsquo;s a Brownian motion?&lt;</li>
<li>what&rsquo;s the Stratanovitch integral?</li>
<li>why do we use the Ito integral in finance?&lt;</li>
<li>questions on numerical methods: Monte-Carlo and finite differences.</li>
<li>questions on financial details.</li>
</ul>
<p>I found the approach mostly frustrating: very few people would give interesting (or even good) answers, because most people are not that well prepared for the interview. The exception goes to the academic kind of guy, who usually gives excellent answers, sometimes so good that you feel dumb asking those questions.</p>
<p>People who don&rsquo;t give good answers could actually be good coworkers. When I was junior, I was particularly bad at job interviews. I did not necessarily know object orienting concepts that well, even if I started programming at an early age. After a few years, I did not know database theory well either because I had experience only with simple queries, having mostly worked on other stuff. A failed interview made me look more closely at the subject, and it turns out that you can sound like an expert after reading only 1 relatively short book (and the theory is actually quite interesting). I went later to the extreme of complex queries, and then realized <a href="/post/use-orm-for-better-performance/">why ORMs are truely important</a>. Similarly when I first interviewed for the &ldquo;finance&rdquo; industry, I sounded very dumb, barely knowing what options were. It&rsquo;s natural to make mistakes, and to not know much. I learnt all that through various mentor coworkers who indirectly encouraged me with their enthusiasm to read the right stuff. What&rsquo;s valuable is the ability to learn, and maybe, when you are very experienced, your past experiences (which might not match at all the interviewer knowledge).</p>
<p>Similarly, I sometimes appeared extremely good to interviewers, because it turned out I had practiced similar tests as their own out of curiosity not much time before the interview.</p>
<p>There is also a nasty aspect on asking precise pre-formatted technical questions, you will tend to think that everybody is dumb because they can&rsquo;t answer those basic questions you know so well, turning you into an arrogant asshole.</p>
<p>I also tried asking probability puzzles (requiring only basic maths knowledge). This gave even less clues towards the candidates in general, except for the exceptional one, where, again you feel a bit dumb for asking those.</p>
<p>In the end, I noticed that the most interesting part of the interview was to discuss a subject the candidate knew well, with the idea of trying to extract knowledge from the candidate, to learn something from him.</p>
<p>I believe this is might be what the interview should only be about. Furthermore, you don&rsquo;t feel like you are losing your time with such an approach.</p>

  </h1>
  <time datetime="2014-04-18T22:18:00Z" class="post-date">Fri, Apr 18, 2014</time>
  <p>I am currently reading the book &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nonlinear-Pricing-Chapman-Financial-Mathematics/dp/1466570334/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1397852099&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=nonlinear+option+pricing">Nonlinear Option Pricing</a>&rdquo; by J. Guyon and P. Henry-Labordère. It&rsquo;s quite interesting even if the first third is quite theoretical. For example they describe how to solve some not well defined non-linear parabolic PDE by relying on the parabolic envelope. They also explain why most problems lead to parabolic PDEs in finance.</p>
<p>The rest is a bit more practical. I stumbled upon an good remark regarding Longstaff-Schwartz: the algorithm as Longstaff and Schwarz describe it does not necessary lead to a low-biased estimate as they use future information (the paths they regress on) in the Monte-Carlo estimate. It was actually <a href="/post/quasi-monte-carlo--longstaff-schwartz-american-option-price/">a subject of discussion</a> with colleagues, and I analyzed the numerical impact in a simple use case in <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2262259">http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2262259</a> In short: it&rsquo;s actually more precise to include the path, even if the estimate is not purely low biased anymore, but the bias is really small in practice.</p>
<p>On the same subject I was a bit surprised that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1404.1180&amp;ei=LYhRU_iZGqWO7Qb9x4HYDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGfwQQ-TumcT5nv8gk1BiUCoRn8Qw&amp;sig2=uqPbG7aLjmZ1crAxUYP_FA&amp;bvm=bv.65058239,d.ZGU">a recent paper</a> on American Monte-Carlo regressed systematically on all paths instead of just a subset. One interesting part of the paper is a way to do successive regressions on different blocks of paths.</p>
<p>Those details are rarely discussed in papers and books. It was comforting to see that I am not alone to wonder about all this.</p>

P. Jaeckel has defied the limits of accuracy with his<a href="http://www.pjaeckel.webspace.virginmedia.com/LetsBeRational.7z" target="_blank"> latest Black-Scholes volatility solver</a>, managing to also improve performance compared to his earlier solver "<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pjaeckel.webspace.virginmedia.com%2FByImplication.pdf&amp;ei=dwNAU5zkO4aI7AaFy4H4BQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1RnfynBrckd79E9RVbhVhuXQrQg&amp;sig2=kOxFO9jmD3wL1E94GjYhRQ&amp;bvm=bv.64125504,d.ZGU" target="_blank">By Implication</a>". Out of a silly exercise, I decided to try my hand for a more accurate <a href="http://www.clarusft.com/analytic-implied-basis-point-volatility/" target="_blank">Normal (or basis point) volatility solver</a>.<br /><br />In reality, the problem is much simpler in the Bachelier/Normal model. A very basic analysis of Bachelier formula shows that the problem can be reduced to a single variable, as Choi et al explain in <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504860802583436" target="_blank">their paper</a>. So the problem is not really one of solving, but one of approximating (the inverse of) a function.<br /><br />The first step to build that function is to actually have a highly accurate slow solver as reference. This is quite easy, I just started with Choi formula and used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_method" target="_blank">Halley's method</a> to refine. In reality, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_method" target="_blank">Halley's method</a> is already a bit overkill on this problem: it works impressively well, 1 iteration is enough to have an insane level of accuracy, only noticeable when one works in high precision arithmetic (for example 50 digits). For double precision, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method" target="_blank">Newton's method</a> would actually be enough - I initially thought that my Halley's implementation did not work as it produced the exact same output as Newton in double precision. <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14697680902849361" target="_blank">Li proposes</a> the use of the SOR method, which for this exercise, behaves very much like Newton's method.<br /><br />I then followed the logic from Choi et al, but working directly with in-the-money call options instead of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straddle" target="_blank">straddles</a>. Straddles sound neat at first (hides that we work in-the-money), but it's actually useless for the algorithm. Choi et al. ignore half of the straddle range when they use their eta transform in the paper. One other change is the mapping itself, I found a better mapping for the call options (but not that far of Choi initial idea). Finally, because I am lazy, I did not go to the pain of finding a good rational fraction approximation along with the square root problem they describe, I just tried a Chebyshev polynomial.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a single Chebyshev polynomial does not work well: even with a very large (1000) degree it's not very precise, so much that I thought that my transform was garbage. I had noticed by mistake, that on another part (negative) of the interval, the Chebyshev polynomial worked actually very well to approximate something related to the volatility of another option. Suddendly came to me the idea of, like Johnson does in <a href="http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Faddeeva_Package" target="_blank">his Faddeeva package</a>, using N Chebyshev polynomials on N small intervals. This is like the big heavy hammer for which everything looks like nails, but it's actually very fast to evaluate as the degree of each polynomial can then be low (7), plus a table lookup (could be coded as switch statements if one really cares about such details). The slowest part is actually the call to the log function.<br /><br />The final bit is the use of a Taylor approximation for my -u/log(1-u) transform as it is not all that accurate in double precision when u is near 0. And that produces the following graph<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r3FCXrjN13k/U0AHWIg7MRI/AAAAAAAAHGU/yDE6BEPtmIs/s1600/Screenshot+from+2014-04-05+15%253A37%253A03.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r3FCXrjN13k/U0AHWIg7MRI/AAAAAAAAHGU/yDE6BEPtmIs/s1600/Screenshot+from+2014-04-05+15%253A37%253A03.png" height="342" width="400" /></a></div><br />It is interesting to note that "solving" the b.p. vol is <b>10x faster</b> than solving the Black vol.<br /><br />I wrote <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2420757" target="_blank">a small paper around all this</a> where you'll find the details as well as Matlab code.

  <p>The calibration of a stochastic volatility model or a volatility surface parameterization (like SVI) involves minimizing the model options volatilities against market options volatilities. Often, the model computes an option price, not an implied volatility. It is therefore useful to have a fast way to invert that option price to get back the implied volatility that corresponds to it. Furthermore during the calibration procedure, the model option price can vary widely: it is convenient to have a robust implied volatility solver.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another more basic use of implied volatility solvers, is for the computation of Black-Scholes greeks for a given market option price.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A few years ago, P.

  <p>Tension splines can produce in some cases <!-- raw HTML omitted -->arbitrage free C2 interpolation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of options, but unfortunately this is not guaranteed. It turns out that, on some not so nice looking data, where the discrete probability density is not monotone but only positive, all previously considered interpolation fail (spline in volatility or variance, tension spline in log prices, harmonic spline on prices).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->K     vol   put   b-slope  b-convexity<!-- raw HTML omitted -->300.0 0.682 0.090 0.00e+00 0.00e+00<!-- raw HTML omitted -->310.0 0.654 0.136 4.60e-03 0.00e+00<!-- raw HTML omitted -->320.0 0.621 0.192 5.60e-03 1.00e-03<!-- raw HTML omitted -->330.0 0.594 0.288 9.60e-03 4.00e-03<!-- raw HTML omitted -->340.0 0.560 0.404 1.16e-02 2.00e-03<!-- raw HTML omitted -->350.0 0.520 0.530 1.26e-02 1.00e-03<!-- raw HTML omitted -->360.0 0.484 0.736 2.06e-02 8.00e-03<!-- raw HTML omitted -->370.0 0.467 1.232 4.96e-02 2.90e-02<!-- raw HTML omitted -->380.0 0.442 1.898 6.66e-02 1.70e-02<!-- raw HTML omitted -->390.0 0.427 3.104 1.21e-01 5.40e-02<!-- raw HTML omitted -->400.0 0.412 4.930 1.83e-01 6.20e-02<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Possibly the simplest arbitrage free interpolation is to postulate the density as piecewise constant, ideally centered around each strike (if not centered, there is no guarantee that it will be positive). If a spline is used for interpolation, this means a quadratic spline. Unfortunately, because it is not C2, it then still fails to be arbitrage free.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is also possible to price by integrating the payoff over the density.

  </h1>
  <time datetime="2014-03-11T17:05:00Z" class="post-date">Tue, Mar 11, 2014</time>
  <p>In a previous post, I have explored the <a href="/post/arbitrage-free-wiggles">arbitrage free wiggles</a> in the volatility surface that P. Jaeckel found in <a href="http://www.pjaeckel.webspace.virginmedia.com/ClampingDownOnArbitrage.pdf">his paper</a>. I showed that interpolating in log prices instead of prices was enough to remove the wiggles, but then, it appears that the interpolation is not guaranteed to be arbitrage free, even though it often is. On another example from P. Jaeckel paper, that I reproduced inaccurately but well enough, it is not.</p>
<p>Using a Harmonic spline instead of a regular cubic spline seems to be enough to make the interpolation arbitrage free in practice (although not in theory as log-prices are not convex), but it is only C1.</p>
<p>One can use a tension spline instead. There is an algorithm from Pruess that updates the tension parameters so as to make the interpolation monotone and convex. It can be tweaked to ensure that the interpolation follows:
$$f&rsquo;^2 + f&rsquo;&rsquo; \geq 0$$</p>
<p>This condition makes the interpolation on the log prices arbitrage free. As a first draft experiment, I just ensured numerically that the condition was valid, the resulting algorithm was fast enough and worked reasonably well.</p>
<p>Here is how the normalized density looks like with a simple harmonic spline on the call prices, a cubic spline in the logarithm of call prices, and an optimized tension spline in the logarithm of call prices.</p>

      <h4>logarithm of the curvature</h4>

</figure>

The blank spot for the Log curve (spline) corresponds to negative curvature, that is, arbitrage. Notice how the tension spline is fully continuous, with no real spikes.</p>

</figure>

<p>The implied volatility curve is very close to a more classic cubic spline interpolation on the implied variance.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course, the same kind of algorithm can be applied directly to the variance with a slightly different numerical test to ensure it is arbitrage-free, it might however be easier to find a more robust and more clever algorithm in the log prices.</p>
