    <a href="https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/cracking-the-double-precision-gaussian-puzzle/">Cracking the Double Precision Gaussian Puzzle</a>
  </h1>
  <time datetime="2013-03-22T12:20:00Z" class="post-date">Fri, Mar 22, 2013</time>
  <p>In my <a href="https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/a-double-precision-puzzle-with-the-gaussian/">previous post</a>, I stated that some library (SPECFUN by W.D. Cody) computes \(e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}\) the following way:
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-C" data-lang="C"><span style="display:flex;"><span>xsq <span style="color:#666">=</span> fint(x <span style="color:#666">*</span> <span style="color:#40a070">1.6</span>) <span style="color:#666">/</span> <span style="color:#40a070">1.6</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>del <span style="color:#666">=</span> (x <span style="color:#666">-</span> xsq) <span style="color:#666">*</span> (x <span style="color:#666">+</span> xsq);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>result <span style="color:#666">=</span> exp(<span style="color:#666">-</span>xsq <span style="color:#666">*</span> xsq <span style="color:#666">*</span> <span style="color:#40a070">0.5</span>) <span style="color:#666">*</span> exp(<span style="color:#666">-</span>del <span style="color:#666">*</span><span style="color:#40a070">0.5</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div></p>
<p>where <code class="code-inline language-C">fint(z)</code> computes the floor of z.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why 1.6?</li>
</ol>
<p>An integer divided by 1.6 will be an exact representation of the corresponding number in double: 1.6 because of 16 (dividing by 1.6 is equivalent to multiplying by 10 and dividing by 16 which is an exact operation). It also allows to have something very close to a rounding function: x=2.6 will make xsq=2.5, x=2.4 will make xsq=1.875, x=2.5 will make xsq=2.5. The maximum difference between x and xsq will be 0.625.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><code class="code-inline language-C">(a<span style="color:#666">-</span>b) <span style="color:#666">*</span> (a<span style="color:#666">+</span>b)</code> decomposition</li>
</ol>
<p>del is of the order of <code class="code-inline language-C"><span style="color:#40a070">2</span> <span style="color:#666">*</span> x <span style="color:#666">*</span> (x<span style="color:#666">-</span>xsq)</code>. When <code class="code-inline language-C">(x<span style="color:#666">-</span>xsq)</code> is very small, <code class="code-inline language-C">del</code> will, most of the cases be small as well: when x is too high (beyond 39), the result will always be 0, because there is no small enough number to represent <code class="code-inline language-C">exp(<span style="color:#666">-</span><span style="color:#40a070">0.5</span> <span style="color:#666">*</span> <span style="color:#40a070">39</span> <span style="color:#666">*</span> <span style="color:#40a070">39</span>)</code> in double precision, while <code class="code-inline language-C">(x<span style="color:#666">-</span>xsq)</code> can be as small as machine epsilon (around 2E-16). By splitting <code class="code-inline language-C">x <span style="color:#666">*</span> x</code> into <code class="code-inline language-C">xsq <span style="color:#666">*</span> xsq</code> and <code class="code-inline language-C">del</code>, the exp function works on a more refined value of the remainder <code class="code-inline language-C">del</code>, which in turn should lead to an increase of accuracy.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Real world effect</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make x move by machine epsilon and see how the result varies using the naive implementation <code class="code-inline language-C">exp(<span style="color:#666">-</span><span style="color:#40a070">0.5</span><span style="color:#666">*</span>x<span style="color:#666">*</span>x)</code> and using the refined Cody way. We take x=20, and add machine epsilon a number of times (frac).
<figure><img src="/post/snapshot1.png"/><figcaption>
            <h4>PDF</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

The staircase happens because if we add machine epsilon to 20, this results in the same 20, until we add it enough to describe the next number in double precision accuracy. But what&rsquo;s interesting is that Cody staircase is regular, the stairs have similar height while the Naive implementation has stairs of uneven height.</p>
<p>To calculate the actual error, we must rely on higher precision arithmetic.
<strong>Update March 22, 2013</strong>
I thus looked for a higher precision exp implementation, that can go beyond double precision. I initially found an online calculator (not so great to do tests on), and after more search, I found one very simple way: mpmath python library. I did some initial tests with the calculator and thought Cody was in reality not much better than the Naive implementation. The problem is that my tests were wrong, because the online calculator expects an input in terms of human digits, and I did not always use the correct amount of digits. For example a double of -37.7 is actually -37.</p>
<p>Here is a plot of the relative error of our methods compared to the high accuracy python implementation, but using as input strict double numbers around x=20. The horizontal axis is x-20, the vertical is the relative error.
<figure><img src="/post/snapshot5.png"/><figcaption>
            <h4>PDF relative error around x=20</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

We can see that Cody is really much more accurate (more than 20x). The difference will be lower when x is smaller, but there is still a factor 10 around x=-5.7:
<figure><img src="/post/snapshot7.png"/><figcaption>
            <h4>PDF around x=-5.7</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>Any calculation using a Cody like Gaussian density implementation, will likely not be as careful as this, so one can doubt of the usefulness in practice of such accuracy tricks. The Cody implementation uses 2 exponentials, which can be costly to evaluate, however Gary Kennedy commented out that we can cache the exp xsq because of fint and therefore have accuracy and speed.</p>

  <p>Some library computes the Gaussian density function $$e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$$ the following way:

<p>where <code class="code-inline language-C">fint(z)</code> computes the floor of z.</p>
<p>Basically, <code class="code-inline language-C">x<span style="color:#666">*</span>x</code> is rewritten as <code class="code-inline language-C">xsq<span style="color:#666">*</span>xsq<span style="color:#666">+</span>del</code>. I have seen that trick once before, but I just can&rsquo;t figure out where and why (except that it is probably related to high accuracy issues).</p>

A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_swap">Volatility swap</a> is a forward contract on future realized volatility. The pricing of such a contract used to be particularly challenging, often either using an unprecise popular expansion in the variance, or a model specific way (like Heston or local volatility with Jumps). Carr and Lee have recently proposed a way to price those contracts in a model independent way in their paper "<i>robust replication of volatility derivatives</i>". Here is the difference between the value of a synthetic volatility swap payoff at maturity (a newly issued one, with no accumulated variance) and a straddle.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JMJOpTJ3hug/UT9kCR4k25I/AAAAAAAAGRw/nxE37l7KvN8/s1600/Screenshot+from+2013-03-12+18:14:34.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="312" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JMJOpTJ3hug/UT9kCR4k25I/AAAAAAAAGRw/nxE37l7KvN8/s400/Screenshot+from+2013-03-12+18:14:34.png" width="400" /></a></div>Those are very close payoffs!<br /><br />I wonder how good is the discrete Derman approach compared to a standard integration for such a payoff as well as how important is the extrapolation of the implied volatility surface.<br /><br />The real payoff (very easy to obtain through Carr-Lee Bessel formula):<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-95Wzs3hgNBI/UUIbC_ri6XI/AAAAAAAAGSA/D9ZfEYZ6n7E/s1600/Screenshot+from+2013-03-14+19:46:16.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="254" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-95Wzs3hgNBI/UUIbC_ri6XI/AAAAAAAAGSA/D9ZfEYZ6n7E/s320/Screenshot+from+2013-03-14+19:46:16.png" width="320" /></a></div>&nbsp;

  <p>I found a nice finite difference scheme, where the solving part can be parallelized on 2 processors at each time-step</p>
<p>I was a bit surprised to notice that the parallelized algorithm ran in some cases twice slower than the same algorithm not parallelized. I tried ForkJoinPool, ThreadPoolExecutor, my one notify/wait based parallelization. All resulted in similar performance compared to just calling thread1.run() and thread2.run() directly.</p>
<p>I am still a bit puzzled by the results. Increasing the time of the task by increasing the number of discretization points does not really improve the parallelization. The task is relatively fast to perform and is repeated many (around of 1000) times, so synchronized around 1000 times, which is likely why parallelization is not great on it: synchronization overhead reaps any benefit of the parallelization. But I expected better. Using a Thread pool of 1 thread is also much slower than calling run() twice (and fortunately slower than the pool of 2 threads).</p>

  <p>I still did not abandon Scala despite my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->previous post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, mainly because I have already quite a bit of code, and am too lazy to port it. Furthermore the issues I detailed were not serious enough to motivate a switch. But these days I am more and more fed up with Scala, especially because of the Eclipse plugin. I tried the newer, the beta, and the older, the stable, the conclusion is the same. It&rsquo;s welcome but:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->code completion is not great compared to Java. For example one does not seem to be able to see the constructor parameters, or the method parameters can not be automatically populated.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->the plugin makes Eclipse <em>very</em> slow. Everything seems at least 3-5x slower. On the fly compilation is also much much slower than Java&rsquo;s.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s nice to type less, but if overall writing is slower because of the above issues, it does not help. Beside curiosity of a new language features, I don&rsquo;t see any point in Scala today, even if some of the ideas are interesting. I am sure it will be forgotten/abandoned in a couple of years. Today, if I would try a new language, I would give Google Go a try: I don&rsquo;t think another big language can make it/be useful on the JVM (beside a scripting kind of language, like JavaScript or Jython).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Go focuses on the right problem: concurrency.

  </h1>
  <time datetime="2013-02-01T18:22:00Z" class="post-date">Fri, Feb 1, 2013</time>
  <p>In my Linux quest, I changed distribution again on my home desktop, from OpenSuse 11.1 with KDE to Ubuntu 13.04 (not yet released - so alpha) with Unity. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>KDE was crashing a bit too often for my taste (more than once a week). Although I enjoyed the KDE environment.</li>
<li>Not easy to transfer files to my Android 4.2 phone. Ubuntu 13.04 is not fully there yet, but is on its way.</li>
<li>zypper is a bit too specific for my taste. I would be ok with yum+rpm or apt-get, but another tool just for a single distribution, not really.</li>
<li>Plus I&rsquo;m just curious what&rsquo;s next for Ubuntu, and Linux makes it very simple to change distributions, and reinstall applications with the same settings. So it&rsquo;s never a big task to change distribution.</li>
<li>I somehow like how Ubuntu feels, not sure what it is exactly, maybe the Debian roots.</li>
</ul>
<p>When people say OpenSuse is rock solid, I don&rsquo;t have that impression, at least on the desktop. It might have been true in the past. But in the past, most distros were very stable. I never remember having big stability issues until, maybe, late 2010. In the early 2000s, a laptop would work very well with Linux, suspend included. I remember that my Dell Inspiron 8200 was working perfectly with Mandrake and WindowMaker. Nowadays, it never seem to work that well, but is just ok: Optimus comes to mind (especially with external screen), suspend problems, wifi (not anymore).</p>
<p>So far I can see that Ubuntu 13.04 is prettier than the past versions, the installer is great. I encrypted my two hard disks, it was just a matter of ticking a box - very nice. Unity Launcher, while interesting, is still not the greatest tool to find an installed application (compared to KDE launcher or Gnome Shell). I don&rsquo;t notice any stability issue so far, even though I have some popup messages that sometimes tells me something crashed (typical for an alpha version). If I just ignore the messages, everything seems fine. OpenSuse-KDE was logging me out (session crash), or just stopped completely being responsive (hard reset necessary).</p>

  <p>Sometimes it feels like big companies try to enforce the Productivity Zero rule.</p>
<p>Here is a guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>involve as many team as possible. It will help ensuring endless discussions about who is doing what, and then how do I interface with them. This is most (in)efficient when team managers interact and are not very technically competent. One consequence is that nobody is fully responsible/accountable, which helps reinforce the productivity zero.</li>
<li>meetings, meetings and meetings. FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt) is king here. By spreading FUD, there will be more and more meetings. Even if the &ldquo;project&rdquo; is actually not a real project, but amounts to 10 lines of code, it is possible to have many meetings around it, over the span of several months (because everybody is always busy with other tasks). Another strategy is to use vocabulary, talk about technical or functional parts the others don&rsquo;t understand. Some people are masters are talking technical to functional people and vice versa.</li>
<li>multiply by 20, not 2. It is surprisingly easy to tell upper management something is going to take 3 months, when, in fact, it can be done in 3 days. This is a bit like bargaining in South East Asia: it&rsquo;s always amazing to find out how much you can push the price down (or how much they push it up).</li>
<li>hire as many well paid managers and product specialists as you can, and make sure they know nothing about the product or the functional parts but are very good at playing the political game without any content. Those people often manage to stay a long time, a real talent.</li>
</ul>

I was looking for an implementation of the non central chi squared distribution function in Java, in order to price bond options under the Cox Ingersoll Ross (CIR) model and compare to a finite difference implementation.

It relies on Apache commons maths for the Gamma function implementation. I looked at what was there in C/C++. There is some old fortran based ports with plenty of goto statements. There is also a nice <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/libs/math/doc/sf_and_dist/html/math_toolkit/dist/dist_ref/dists/nc_chi_squared_dist.html">implementation in the Boost library</a>. It turns out it is quite easy to port it to Java. One still needs a Gamma function implementation, I looked at Boost implementation of it and it turns out to be very similar to the Apache commons maths one (which is surprisingly not too object oriented and therefore quite fast - maybe they ported it from Boost or from a common source).<br /><br />The Boost implementation seems much more robust in general thanks to:<br /><ul><li>The use of complimentary distribution function when the value is over 0.5. One drawback is that there is only one implementation of this, the Benton and Krishnamoorthy one, which is a bit slower than Ding's method.</li><li>Reverts to <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ucs.louisiana.edu%2F~kxk4695%2FCSDA-03.pdf&amp;ei=LKzlUKWvL_K00QX_t4CYBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFgkeariqMPXVH4LLrO5RRi3nIc0Q">Benton and Krishnamoorthy</a> method in high non-centrality cases. Benton and Krishnamoorthy is always very accurate, while Fraser (used by OpenGamma) is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CEIQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdspace.uevora.pt%2Frdpc%2Fbitstream%2F10174%2F4635%2F1%2FSpeedAccuracyCEV_FFM%255B1%255D.pdf&amp;ei=Ea3lULLsBaPL0QXKuoHYAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGkqkA5e_-0n_DATE9BTQVoL9NTkg&amp;cad=rja">not very precise in general</a>.</li></ul>It is interesting to note that both implementations of Ding method are wildly different, Boost implementation has better performance and is simpler (I measured that my Java port is around 50% faster than OpenGamma implementation).<br /><br />If only it was simple to commit to open-source projects while working for a software company...
