  </h1>
  <time datetime="2005-12-07T17:48:00Z" class="post-date">Wed, Dec 7, 2005</time>
  <p>I digged a bit deeper in a current project where they use IBM Websphere Portal Server (WPS) with IBM Web Content Management (WCM). I found out that both products collide and disintegrate.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> WCM is like a regular content management system, quite flexible and performant on its own. It has a nice way to separate layout concern from content concern. It has a flexible cache. It has a user repository to set different permissions. Its architecture is even so well done (very modular) that you can tailor it to your needs to do things a content management system is not supposed to do. It could do most of what you would do with a Portal system. And that&rsquo;s the problem.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> WPS is a Porlet server, now compatible with JSR 168. You can again do the layout of your portlets, you have an administrative interface to handle them and one to handle user permissions. There is a caching system although it&rsquo;s not very clear how that works. Standard administration Portlets seem awfully slow to use any cache. To be integrate WCM content in the Portal Server, they ship a WCM Portlet. While JSR 168 API is recommended by IBM, the WCM Portlet is not a JSR 168 one.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> So you have 2 products where you can layout your pages, and have dynamic behaviour in them, locally as components, easily manageable. One can be embedded in the other, but it does not make much sense, because you would then just use a tiny part of its possibilities, and its flexibility will be more a burden (extra abstraction layer) than anything. The integration of the 2 products is very superficial. Although recently they can share a common user repository, the WCM portlet does not do any caching of WCM content, linking between content and portlets is a very cumbersome task. IBM provides tips to build a framework that does just that. All that for not using most of the WCM possibilities and always having difficulties in defining their roles and using them collaboratively.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Now, if you look at how JBoss Portal works, and what features they focused on, you will see a well designed solution whose aim is to build pragmatically a Portal using Portlets. They have a very simple content management system used to administrate HTML snippets. Content is put inside the Portal page using CMS Portlets, the layout is the one you specified in the Portal page. They provide automatic caching of CMS content and easy to use links. Integration with their CMS is already using JSR 170 standard. You can plugin other CMS systems easily.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> IBM strategy with their WPS+CMS does not look very good, and their version is currently 5.1, soon 6.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

  <p>Recently, I have had my first encounter with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Portlets<!-- raw HTML omitted --> although Portlets are not very new. IBM had their own Portlet API before the JSR 168 was final in 2003. Unfortunately both approaches are quite different and IBM does not recommend the use of their own API.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Portlets were a needed concept for a long time. I worked in 2000 on a java portal system and it would have been handy at that time. Portals are everywhere since the internet bubble. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> But Portlets do not do that much either. Sites designed with strict and intelligent rules can bypass the portlets need for example by using a combination of custom tags and java beans.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> What shocks me a bit more is that while not doing much, it looks a bit old fashioned already. With AJAX you could build very flexible and user-friendly Portlets replacement. This AJAX-let is actually probably what Microsoft has already done on their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->start.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> web site. Now with AJAX, I just wish Javascript would evolve (a lot) or die to be more OO friendly.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

  <p>A friend asked me for a list, here is it. I found those books the most interesting ones among those I have read about software in the past year or two:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Artificial Intelligence through Prolog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by Neil C. Rowe (Prentice-Hall): if you don&rsquo;t remember much about Prolog, it&rsquo;s a good book. It details how Prolog interpreters work.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->File Systems Forensic Analysis, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by Brian Carrier (Addison Wesley): everything you need to know about disks and file systems, every trick to recover lost data. To go more in depth into file systems theory, you can read the free <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Practical File System Design with the Be File System<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->from D. Giampaolo, the creator of BeFS.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mind Hacks <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(O&rsquo;Reilly): you probably already bought that one. Not about software, but excellent.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Practical Issues in Database Management<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Fabian Pascal (Addison Wesley): short but concise book on relational database theory. F Pascal is of CJ Date school of thoughts, &ldquo;null are evil&rdquo;. You don&rsquo;t need to read it if you have read any other similar book (by CJ Date for example).<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inside The Java Virtual Machine,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Bill Venners (McGraw-Hill): there are other books on the same subject. While this book has some bad reviews, I found it an easy read, and it explain well enough for me all the inner details of Java. I found &ldquo;Programming for the Java Virtual Machine&rdquo; not better, and with some bad example of a Prolog language for the JVM (1 full chapter for this to present a way too simple thing to be of any use).<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Programming Jabber<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by O&rsquo;Reilly: I have read it 2 years ago, I enjoyed how they made you go through building a Jabber server.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lucene In Action<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: the only book about Lucene, some of the info is useful to understand how it is designed.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hibernate In Action:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if you have to use hibernate, this is the book to read. It presents different ways of using it.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some Javascript+DHTML(+CSS) book: useful if you have none. They often have good tricks to solve the usual problems. In the AJAX days, it becomes useful again. I find O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Javascript - The Definitive Guide<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; good to have an API reference (as ebook), and &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Javascript and DHTML Cookbook<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; has the most useful recipes.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lean Software Development <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by Poppendieck (Addison Wesley): easy to read, good presentation of software dev management problems and pragmatic solutions. My favorite on the subject. Another good one but very specific is &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Requirements Management<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; (MS Press).<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->UML Distilled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by M Fowler: always useful to have if you need to draw UML diagrams.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Good luck!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tags: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->book<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->review<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

  <p>I find the mac mini a particularly compelling computer. It is small, noise friendly, relatively cheap. If you want to have a cheap home server (based on Linux or MacOS X), this is quite a good choice as you probably don&rsquo;t want to hear all the fans of bigger computers the whole day. It&rsquo;s also a very good candidate for a media box: you can connect a huge hard drive for mp3s, and watch your DVDs, photos on a nice LCD (and MacOS helps here).<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Unfortunately it might not be the best moment to buy it now. There are rumors everywhere that the first Mac Intel will be presented in January. And I am quite confident that this Mac Intel will be the Mac Mini. Here are the reasons:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PowerMacs and iMacs use the quite modern G5 processor. It makes sense to update the very old G4 to Intel first.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->if iBook was updated, it would be much more attractive than the Powerbook.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> This leaves us with either powerbook upgrade or mac mini upgrade, but:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XBox 360 has almost arrived. While not a direct competitor, it can be used as media center, it is cheap and powerful. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s not customizable enough.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Powerbooks got a recent update. They are advertised heavily on apple websites, while the mac mini had just a silent and minor upgrade and is not advertised anymore.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tags: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->apple<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mac<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->intel<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rumors<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

  </h1>
  <time datetime="2005-11-07T16:29:00Z" class="post-date">Mon, Nov 7, 2005</time>
  <p>In 1998, a student of my school had a project with Sun about EJBs. This was the beginning of EJBs, they were not public, and there was no J2EE. At that time he found it utterly complicated, and had difficulties to understand why they made it so complicated.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In 2000, I worked for a company who had built in-house most components of a today J2EE application server. For example, they had their own unified messaging system, on the JSP side, they were already using custom tags, etc.. Their problem is that they took lots of time to develop in-house, all what later became standard, and almost freely available.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Today, 7 years later, the big talk, new Java products, be it Spring, or JBoss Seam, are still all about the same ideas as in the first J2EE. Spring has the freedom to include whatever technology, but in the end, their scope closely matches J2EE scope. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), the current buzzword, will come out relatively naturally with J2EE, session EJBs being natural candidate to expose functionalities to the outer world. JBoss (or Geronimo) architecture is fully SOA: a small kernel managing services, that are exposed for other to use.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To learn about EJBs, I still find <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Enterprise JavaBeans<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Richard Monson-Haefel, the best book. The chapter (in the 2nd Edition of the book, not in the 4th unfortunately) where he rolls his own distributed objects system is for me a testimony on how well he wants you to understand what&rsquo;s behind EJBs. And if you want to better understand what&rsquo;s behind RMI, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Java Distributed Computing (O&rsquo;Reilly)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> has a chapter where the author rolls his own RMI.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To conclude, Sun was really clever in defining J2EE scope and branding several Java technologies as J2EE (despite the awful version naming). While the ideas were very good, the developer&rsquo;s life was forgotten. It was too much a pain in the a** and not flexible enough (especially the ORM side). JBoss gets it right, what people need is a way to use pieces of J2EE, without imposing too much unnecessary hurdle on development.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tags: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->java<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ejb<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->j2ee<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->book<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

  <p>I have been doing interviews those past weeks. Today I had to present my resume for the N time where N is big. It is very boring. In France, it is common to have 5 interviews for a small company <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(that says a bit about how people trust each other and makes me envy Germany where the practice is to select very strictly on the resume and be more relax about interviews)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But all those interviews give a valuable insight on the current market, and on some companies.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->0. The Monster Rage<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first 2 days after I put my resume on Monster France, I got more than 15 calls from consulting companies. The following day, I removed my resume from Monster.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. Interviewing People<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I started working, I was very bad at interviews, I had a good academic record and thought companies ringing me would have been interested automatically. I supposed most people were dedicated to their work and did not bother doing a show, I was passive. So I often failed the interview process at the HR level.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now I am doing the show everybody expects and it always works. Only one person asked me an unusual, clever question: &ldquo;Do you write?&rdquo; or<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Do you like to write?&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am often more stressed by technical interviews as I find technical interviews can more easily be very badly done. Even specialists don&rsquo;t agree on a good method, cf the artima article on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How to Interview a Programmer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If someone asks you about some intricate details he knows lots about and you don&rsquo;t, or you used to but you don&rsquo;t remember, then that person can have a bad impression of you. In Java, this can be the supposedly trivial ,&ldquo;what classes do you have to implement for an EJB ?&rdquo;. I have done many EJBs in the past, but that was a long time enough that I need to look up somewhere to find the exact and precise answer. It is much better to ask someone about what he recently did, or about someone&rsquo;s view on general subjects, especially subjects he knows about.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Interviewing Companies<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a junior in the business world, I had a very angelic view of companies. I had been lucky enough to do internships around very good people. But nowadays, I am starting to find difficult to pick a good company to work for. I found one question especially useful to find out more about your future mates:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;What do you like in this company?&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->and try to get to know the answer of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Why did you go there?&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. The $$$ in Current Market<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There seem to be huge disparities in salaries in France. I found consulting companies were very reticent to offer a market salary. More regular companies can either offer a much lower salary than the market one, a market salary, or a much higher one, for the same job!</p>

  <p>I am completing my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spring Books Roundup<!-- raw HTML omitted --> books with 2 new books:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pro Spring<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by Apress: a lengthy book, with some unnecessary information, but good overall. I did not like the Part 1, there is not much content in it. Fortunately, Part 2 is much better, dependency injection is very well described, almost on par, with the Fowler article of reference. Other Spring areas are well covered, in a similar manner as in Wrox book, except Java Server Faces, absent from the book, and nothing on Swing as well.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spring Reference Documentation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->springframework.org     <!-- raw HTML omitted -->website: I should have started with this one, it is of very good quality, and more up-to-date. There is notably a very good chapter on &ldquo;Source Level Metadata Support&rdquo; even if I don&rsquo;t find particularly compelling that they chose yet another abstraction behind Java 5 annotations, partly to support older JDKs. Another plus is a chapter on JMX support, this was lacking in other books.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Interestingly most other books are very similar to the reference documentation, in their presentation and content. The reference documentation is extremely well written. Each time the author carefully explains what are the advantages of the Spring solution, or what does a particular feature solve. Only dependency injection and swing are not treated properly.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To conclude, to best learn Spring I would advise:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fowler article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about dependency injection.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Read O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Developer Notebook<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It is the most appropriate book, because the presentation is a bit different, focusing on quickly understanding Spring and using it in your project, and it is the only one mentioning Swing Spring features.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Read the reference manual to find out about the details you need for a specific feature.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tags: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->java<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->spring<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->book<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->review<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

  <p>Spring is hip these days, so I decided to learn a bit more about it. I had used Avalon a while ago, I was attracted by its design by component and the way it seemed to lay out a proper infrastructure to build a server application. In the end, I was a bit disappointed, it required a bit too much glue code for my taste and did not provide that much in exchange. I don&rsquo;t remember if, at that time, it was advertised as IoC (Inversion Of Control) container. This experience is one of the reasons why I did not jump on the Spring ship.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have read 3 books, here is what I thought of them, briefly:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spring: A Developer&rsquo;s Notebook<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by O&rsquo;Reilly: I enjoyed reading that book, because it is well written and has a good structure. It explains what is dependency injection by doing it without Spring, with Spring. But for a more complete understanding, I would recommend     <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fowler article<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There is an interesting chapter on Swing with Spring. Minor drawbacks is that it does not talk about Spring Timers and has very little on Remoting. But I would recommend that book.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spring In Action, by Manning<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I was disappointed by that one, because there is not much more information than in O&rsquo;Reilly, it is a bit less practical to use. While it is a bit more detailed than O&rsquo;Reilly, I did not find the extra information very useful in general. Remoting is better covered here than in O&rsquo;Reilly, but there is nothing on Swing.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Professional Java Development With The Sring Fram<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->p<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ework<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by Wrox: I liked that one better than Manning, but again information inside is very similar. I find the explanations more complete. Inversion Of Control is well presented (it is even comparing constructor injection with method injection). It gives examples of alternatives to XML configuration. Remoting is covered in greater details than Manning. I would recommend it over Manning anytime, and if it included a Swing chapter, I would recommend it over O&rsquo;Reilly as well.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> You can wonder a bit why there are 3 books on Spring, that similar. I believe there is space for other intelligent presentations of Spring. Subjects are often treated superficially. For example, look at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fowler article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> versus the best chapter about IoC, the one from Wrox, and you&rsquo;ll see how much more detailed it could have been. I find it a bit shocking since IoC is the basis of Spring. It would have been good to see a book explaining why Spring chose that particular design over another, for the main features, and presenting alternatives better. I would also have welcomed a book explaining the use of maybe just a few Spring aspects, but in the frame of a big, commercial application. For example after reading those books, it is not immediately clear to me what are Spring benefits when using Swing support versus other solutions. Another critic is that all those books were written around the same time, and are sometimes already obsolete. None of them describes Spring JDK 1.5 support  (for transactions or JMX or metadata). The official free Spring reference book seems better in many ways.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Those books showed me Spring could be useful in some projects:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->if you want remoting.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->if you want to promote clean code, then you can promote the &ldquo;Spring way&rdquo;. It is a good one.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->if you want to use JSF. Spring makes JSF easy and natural to use.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> On top of it you get AOP for easy debugging or profiling, which is always useful at some point.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am not convinced about Spring when it comes to:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JDBC or database use: while Spring has a well done framework, Hibernate or iBatis have a very good API that makes Spring abstraction useless.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MVC: it is does seem that much better than alternatives, nor much less intrusive (OK you can test it easily). Anyway I am not that big a fan of web MVC after having seen real world .NET projects without strict MVC well maintainable. I find the JSF backing beans at least as good and more flexible. Continuation frameworks are interesting too, but I am worried of their performance impact and scalability.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Transactions: I just don&rsquo;t think manual transactions are that bad or ugly or less maintainable. But using Spring for them is not necessarily a bad idea either.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    <!-- raw HTML omitted --> To me, the main alternative to Spring, and a very good one, is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JBoss<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I will elaborate on that subject later in another post.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Categories: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->java<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->spring<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->book<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->review<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
