I checked various JDKs for MacOs, no difference. I checked if it was due to antialiasing use, no luck. I actually found out there was an error in the way I displayed images. I did not call repaint() between each image change. Strangely, it worked fine on Windows with many JDKs. Anyway now my  <a href="http://31416.org/info/benham.html" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">Benham Disc Applet</a> is working on Apple computers as well.<br><br>

I updated my little <a href="http://31416.org/deltoolbar.html">delicious toolbar</a> that provides autosave feature for me. I did not bother reworking the new <a href="http://del.icio.us">delicious</a> extension as I don't use its new functionalities. However people are free to do so if they want with the code from this toolbar.<br /><br /><img alt="deltoolbar screenshot" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6384/1303/320/deltoolbar_.jpg" height="403" width="486" /><br /><br />With Firefox 1.5, display of saved documents was not working properly anymore due to a change in Firefox handling of security permissions to view local files. It is fixed now.<br /><span class="technoratitag">Tags: <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/delicious" rel="tag">delicious</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/toolbar" rel="tag">toolbar</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/extension" rel="tag">extension</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/firefox" rel="tag">firefox</a></span>

  <time datetime="2006-03-09T17:10:00Z" class="post-date">Thu, Mar 9, 2006</time>
  <p>Last year, I have helped building an AJAX web application, where the web client was composed of only one web page and tons of javascript. The 1 web page for a site approach is similar to Gmail and many full AJAX sites. This approach looks quite elegant. Using JSON (and JSON templates) we were able to separated fully presentation logic and business logic and componentization seemed to occur naturally.</p>
<p>But I remember how often I complained on how bad Javascript was to code. I find it does not encourage good practices at all. The object orientation of Javascript is really a pain to use. If I had not a small experience with  <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> before, I would have thought scripting languages were really bad at building applications, even not so big ones. I find that even for good programmers, Javascript is a challenge, as it seems to always be a struggle to organize properly your code with it.</p>
<p>I was recently relieved to see that around me, almost nobody likes Javascript either. It is very sad that Netscape chosed such a bad language in 1995. Firefox appears like a miraculous program to me as a lot of the UI is done in Javascript.</p>
<p>Ah! If ever it had been Python all the way.</p>

Bertrand Meyer describes in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0136291554&amp;tag=michelin-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325%22">&quot;<span style="font-style: italic;"> Object Oriented Software Construction (2nd Ed)</span>&quot;</a> qualities that a good object oriented language should have. Java has almost all the features. Ruby is much farther off, which does not mean it is not a good language, I think it's very good to write some types of programs quickly (should I call them scripts?), syntax is quite nice, but it does lack the following useful features: <br><ul><li>Assertions:<blockquote style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;" class="gmail_quote">The language should make it possible to equip a class and its features with assertions (preconditions, postconditions and invariants), relying on tools to produce documentation out of these assertions and, optionally, monitor them at run time.&nbsp; </blockquote></li><li>Information Hiding (Java is not good either on that one, the protected keyword is of dubious value):<blockquote style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;" class="gmail_quote">  It should be possible for the author of a class to specify that a feature is available to all clients, to no client, or to specified clients<br></blockquote></li><li>Static Typing:<blockquote style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;" class="gmail_quote">  A well-defined type system should, by enforcing a number of type declaration and compatibility rules, guarantee the run-time type safety of the systems it accepts.</blockquote></li></ul><ul><li>Genericity:<blockquote style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;" class="gmail_quote">  It should be possible to write classes with formal generic parameters representing arbitrary types.&nbsp;</blockquote></li></ul>More pragmatically, library choice and performance difference between Java and Ruby might be the most decisive. <br><br /><span class="technoratitag">Tags: <a target=_top href="http://del.icio.us/tag/book" rel="tag">book</a> <a target=_top href="http://del.icio.us/tag/review" rel="tag">review</a>

One can specify in ant to compile with modern compilers and a target  1.4, the result is likely to not run on JVM 1.3. One can specify modern and a target 1.1, the resulting classes will run on JVM 1.1, but ant build.xml file will not be usable with JDK 1.1 without changing modern to classic. <br><br>I find Ant choice of word a bit confusing as using a &quot;modern&quot; compiler has little to do with the resulting class files.<br></font>

These days we tried to make Websphere and <a href="http://jonas.objectweb.org">Jonas</a> interoperate. Some EJBs are deployed in Jonas and we just try to call them from Websphere. The most natural way is to use RMI (with JRMP) for that. Jonas uses  JDK1.4.2 (conforms to J2EE 1.4) and Websphere IBM JVM 1.3.1 (conforms to J2EE 1.3). Because of RMI serialization, an EJB from Jonas will not work on Websphere, because this EJB has references to J2EE 1.4 classes which are different from J2EE  1.3. The exact root cause is not exactly clear to me, it probably has to do with the Naming Factory and the EJB Stub, but we tried every possible thing here without success.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update: </span>JRMP worked between JBoss 3.X on JDK 1.4 and Websphere 5.X (IBM JDK 1.3) using JBoss NamingFactory. So RMI interoperation seems quite unpredictable. One thing is that you have to pay attention to the naming factory you use. If it is a special library like in JBoss case, make sure it is compatible with your JDK.<br /><br />One solution is to use RMI-IIOP, as it does not rely on serialization. It almost works. In our case we use Websphere Portal that needs to have security enabled. You might ask what security has to do with all that. Well, enabling security on websphere means that CORBA exchange will also be secured (using CSIv2). Tuning Jonas to understand what websphere asks is something we did not manage to do (and we don't know if it is possible at all).<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update: </span>We did manage to make it work by disabling Jonas CSIv2 support.<br /><br />So there we are using Axis to do the communication!<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update: </span>Axis is not needed anymore  as RMI-IIOP works as advertised.<br /><br />There is an interesting <a href="http://www.lifl.fr/%7Emerle/benchmarking.pdf">benchmark of Axis vs JRMP vs RMI-IIOP (pdf)</a>. Axis is more than 10x slower than pure JRMP. Application servers use of JRMP seems to matter a lot, JBoss looks bad.

  </h1>
  <time datetime="2006-01-16T16:57:00Z" class="post-date">Mon, Jan 16, 2006</time>
  <p>I wanted to reply to <a href="http://www.diegoparrilla.com/2006/01/spring-is-not-designed-for-scalability.html">Diego Parilla post about scalability</a>, but my reply ended up being too long not to post it over here. I don&rsquo;t know if I am the only one here but I don&rsquo;t fully understand his post and arguments.</p>
<p>Clustering the web server and clustering the model are just two parts of clustering, not exclusive.</p>
<p>In a LAMP application, clustering the model is traditionally done by clustering the DB (MySQL) which is a no brainer. Clustering the web server does not always implies sharing the &ldquo;HTTP session&rdquo;. For example you can limit yourself to use cookies. For many web apps this works well.</p>
<p>For more stateful web apps, there are strategies to avoid clustering the session, you can make one client attack one server only for his whole session duration. Another strategy is to use DB where you would use a session. This is actually reported to work quite well. If my memory is right, this is how Friendster rewrote its app (used to be Java and session based, moved to PHP+DB).</p>
<p>EJBs are not about clustering the model more than Spring, they are about clustering the business logic. And I don&rsquo;t see how EJB3 is more scalable than Hibernate.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=36465">latest well done (e.g. blind) listening test</a> comparing Ogg, MPC, MP3, AAC at about 180kbps shows that Ogg is superior to all other compressing formats. It&rsquo;s not that easy to find relevant tests. Many people claim to be able to notice huge differences between CD and MP3 and yet, but confronted to a blind listening test, they are very surprised how difficult it actually is. Hydrogenaudio has a good community of audiophiles.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Ogg is not supported officially in iTunes and not supported in the most popular hardware (iPod). It&rsquo;s been a while now Ogg is out, and even if it is a superior format, unless Apple embraces it, I don&rsquo;t see it succeeding. I wish Apple would make a tiny effort.</p>
<p>In Java it is possible to play ogg files using <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/jorbis/">Jorbis</a> but I did not find any useable Java player compared to Windows foobar2000 or Linux XMMS or Apple iTunes.</p>
