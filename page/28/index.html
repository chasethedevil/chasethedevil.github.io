      <p>I was recently in a meeting where use case complexity was estimated using numbers in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci sequence</a>. I was surprised by the choice of the Fibonacci sequence. Why not any sequence? Why a particular one? I googled and found the culprit,  <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/system/hidden_asset/file/15/aep_sample.pdf">Mr Mike Cohn</a>  in his book Agile Estimating and Planning. It&#39;s actually not a bad sequence to choose, since the scale is increasing constantly, so by picking up numbers in this sequence, you can quite accurately describe estimation. If you have defined complexities of 1,2,3,16,17 corresponding to 5 different use cases then obviously 16 or 17 denotes the same complexity, and it would be surprising that you can really distinguish both. You need an ever increasing scale. But a power of 2 scale might not be precise enough (steps are growing too fast). <br><br>Still I think the main reason for him to chose Fibonacci sequence is due to Da Vinci Code, that was just popular at that time in 2004 when he wrote his book. And then this particular series seduces people easily, be it because of the da vinci code book, or because of a mathematical tool that gives the impression our estimations are better, even if there is no real mathematical reason to use it. <br></p>

      <p>This will seem obvious, unfortunately, when people are involved, nothing is that obvious. It&rsquo;s not because you setup a bug/feature management software that people will use it. You have to force people to go through the bug management software each time they want something fixed. If you don&rsquo;t do that some people will keep sending incomplete mails, or worse call you to get something fixed, that will be forgotten in a week. It is also very useful to avoid receiving 10x the same request from the same person.</p>

      <p>Important points are: standard code hierarchy, automatic download of dependencies, a distribution command with versioning support and source control interaction, a simple command to build each part of the project. In Java best candidates are a sophiticated ant build, or maven2. Maven2 is quite good since it forces you to do some of those steps, even though I think ant can&rsquo;t really be avoided for many more specific tasks.<br /><p>Once, I got wrong code before I left for a customer site, because code given to the customer was not checked into a source repository everytime before it was given to the customer. Furthermore the code I had could not be built because of missing jars, and the project structure forced some source directories containing source code common with other projects to be in a very specific directories at a particular level, because project isolation was poor. It took me 7 days to understand their very awkward build process.</p><p>A good build process is dependent on good CVS (or other source control system) management, which is itself dependent on good code split. CVS head should always compile. If CVS head does not compile, then people will start trying to work around it. Unfortunatly working around it means use it as rarely as possible (either by just not updating your code frequently, or by working in a branch that can not merge well because head is in a bad state). I have seen that on projects, the result is integration headaches, and extremely poor overall quality.<br /></p><p>An good check for a build process is to see how long and how many steps you have to do to build the latest deliverable on a new machine, and how difficult it is to put that in production.<br /></p><p><br /></p></p>

      <p>In an open space, people keep on coming to discuss various issues with various people, issues that have nothing to do with your work. You end up either being distracted, or annoyed by the increased noise level. <p>Apparently at Microsoft, they have private offices for each programmer. It might be extreme, paradoxally not in the XP (extreme programming) sense, but it is much better than open space for productivity. In XP, it&rsquo;s almost the opposite with 2 developers working often together. </p></p>

      <p>If you have to lay off in your job, do it quickly. I don&rsquo;t understand companies that want to keep someone as long as legally possible when this someone wants to leave. First the employee won&rsquo;t be as motivated, but more importantly, you will continue to train that person to your company&rsquo;s software and ways of work. This would be much better used on another person, that will stay in the company. Time for layoffs should exclusively be used for knowledge transfer.</p>

      <p>Someone modified a simple launch script on a integration machine. This pissed off the author of the script. Why?</p> <p>Just because the guy who modified the script never worked before with the author of the script. If only the author had been notified verbally or by mail of the modification, he would have been happy. Furthermore this would increase the quality of the change since the new guy might have made a change that has other impacts, that the author will best evaluate quickly.</p>

      <p>I am starting a series of posts about software construction, based on good and bad experiences while working for my many employers.<br /><br />&ldquo;Software construction (a.k.a. architecture), is the only activity that&rsquo;s guaranteed to happen on every project&rdquo;. It is not rare that projects or new features are abandoned either because they are too costly, or because they are not needed anymore, or because they are other more important priorities.<br /><br />In the same vein: &ldquo;Measure twice, cut once&rdquo;. “Measure twice, cut once” is highly relevant to the construction part of software development, which can account for as much as 65 percent of the total project costs. The worst software projects end up doing construction two or three times or more. Doing the most expensive part of the project twice is as bad an idea in software as it is in any other line of work.<br /><br />When you see Software that change versions (major versions) while not really having been used much, this is a sign there is something wrong in the construction part.</p>

      </span>
      
      <p>My reference book on Java concurrency is Doug Lea&#39;s <span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="srTitle">Concurrent Programming in Java: Design Principles and Patterns</span></span>. He is one of the authors of this new book,  <span style="font-style: italic;">Java Concurrency In Practice</span>. There is also Joshua Bloch, author of <span style="font-style: italic;">Effective Java</span>, that many people love (but I am less a fan of it, even if I would recommend it to Java newbies), and author of  <span style="font-style: italic;">Java Puzzlers</span>, that I found more fun.<br><br>With such authors, I had relatively high expectations. I was surprised that there is not much material in common between Doug Lea&#39;s book and this one, which is a good thing. It&#39;s a different presentation, that focuses on different problems.  <br><br>There is some very interesting material, I especially enjoyed chapter 16 on the Java Memory Model. There are not many&nbsp; books with information on it. I did not know that initializing a final member in the constructor was providing thread safety for the accessor method of the corresponding field if there is no other modifying method, no synchronization needed. And not having the member declared as final was breaking the safety. <br><br>I also had not heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_Law">Amdahl&#39;s law</a>  before. It seems quite intuitive, but then the example in the book about processing parallel tasks using a synchronized LinkedList (improvement up to 3 threads, no more later due to time spent on synchronization) shows that the reality is not that intuitive. <br><br>I enjoyed how the book is written, and how information is presented. There is for example their concept of publication and escape (in chapter 3) which tells you important things, like not starting a Thread in a constructor (and if you still want to do it they present a nice way to do it). <br><br>I think this book is a simpler read that Doug Lea original book, and probably a better introduction (that still goes very deep) to Java concurrency programming.<br><br></p>

      <div>I am currently quite busy learning about Websphere Commerce. I was surprised to notice that they still use Entity EJBs 1.1. My experience was that many companies turned away from Entity EJBs, sometimes from the beginning, preferring TopLink or Hibernate (later). </div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>I know that Entity EJBs are more heavy to use than Hibernate, but with the proper tooling support, it&#39;s not really a big issue. Are there more fundamental reasons? There are probably some mapping limitations, but IBM implementation is apparently quite good in term of features. </div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>I will write a complete post about my own analysis of EJB 1.1 vs IBM EJB 1.1 vs EJB 3.0 vs Hibernate, but I was wondering first what was your feedback on EJB 1.1.</div>
