      <p>I am less enthusiastic about the Apple experience than I was one year ago. <br><br>I am quite enthusiastic with the hardware in general, except the keyboard. The computer is small and quiet, and there are not many competitors at this price on the market. <br><br><font size="2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Experience as a developer</span></font><br>I feel frustrated with MacOs X as a development environment, when compared with Ubuntu Linux. I always miss the multiple desktop, despite expose magnificient look. The standard behaviour for the terminal, bash, vim, etc. are more convenient in Linux. Installing software and updates is much more convenient on Linux thanks to the open source repositories.&nbsp; The key bindings for special characters is awful for a programmer on the Apple keyboard,&nbsp; because non standard, and not even written on the keyboard. Installing linux on a mac mini intel is not trivial, but I am considering it seriously. <br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span>Experience as audio/web user</span><br>No particular complaint about the web, but I use Firefox instead of Safari, because of Firefox Adblock extension. Chat works well, Skype is ok. There are sometimes problems with bluetooth audio for&nbsp; Skype that, I think, are related to MacOs. <br>Audio is good too, I end up finding iTunes ok to use, it is fast enough to manipulate 100GB of songs. But I don&#39;t use any fancy feature, except cd-burning. It makes a good jukebox, and the remote is handy, but not terrific (any wireless keyboard would do in the PC world, for 90% of the cases). <br>Photo is not great, I don&#39;t like iPhoto that much (especially when compared to Picasa). iPhoto is quite slow for me (and I have 2gb of RAM). I found it a pain to install TheGimp on MacOs, not knowing which X server to use. Photoshop is still not compiled for intel, and dog slow on my mac mini. <br>Page is not great either. It does render beautiful letters, but overall I don&#39;t find it very usable compared to more standard software like OpenOffice, and it&#39;s time limited!<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Conclusion</span><br>Overall I think I would not buy a Mac again if comparable PC hardware exists. MacOs is not a bad OS, but I prefer Ubuntu Linux. If you don&#39;t use or like Linux then is really Vista worse? I don&#39;t think so. <br><br></p>

      <p>I used to like the <a href="http://www.javaspecialists.co.za/archive/newsletter.do?issue=137&amp;locale=en_US">java specialists newsletter</a>, most news used to be a bit challenging. Nowadays however the quality is lower. In the  <a href="http://www.javaspecialists.co.za/archive/newsletter.do?issue=137&amp;locale=en_US">latest news</a>, the author proposes to use the StackTrace to get the class name, in order to declare a Logger independently of any explicit reference to the class name. <br><br>While this is a clever hack, it still requires some code to be duplicated in every class, compared to Aspect/IoC approach. But was there really a problem with declaring loggers the usual way in the first place?<br>  <br> With modern IDEs, most people just create a template for the logger declaration line. Also, renaming MyClass to MyClass2 will rename MyClass.class to MyClass2.class automatically. Here is my template for Eclipse to which I assigned the short name log4j:<br> <br><blockquote style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;" class="gmail_quote"> private static final Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger(${enclosing_type}.class);</blockquote><br><br></p>

      <p>I tried a bit <a href="http://djangoproject.com">django</a> for one very simple thing, where django is not of much use, but it was a way to try it with something else than examples on the site. <br><br>Even if django templates features seem very good and very convenient when reading the docs (for example the extends keyword), I found out that the template system is very annoying. Firstly one has to learn another templating system. Secondly, and much more importantly, the debug facilities for templates are close to non existent. I have a better memory using ruby on rails templates (which are not the best either). <br><br>Java templates, based on Velocity, JSPs or JSF are much nicer to debug. PHP (which I consider an ugly language that can unfortunately often gets the job done) used to be crap at debugging, but with eclipse plugin phpeclipse it is much better these days. <br><br>I think templates play a very important role in web application development, and I am surprised that a framework with so many good ideas fails in reality (at least for me) because debugging templates is a pain. Hopefully it will become better one day, but until then bye bye Django. <br></p>

      <p>Google developed <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit">GWT</a>.<br><br>Why would GWT be so well acclaimed if JavaScript was a good language.

      <p>I discovered a new baby in the build world. Some open source projects use a combination of ant and maven. I thought you could vaguely use ant from maven. But I did not know of <a href="http://maven.apache.org/ant-tasks.html"> Maven Antlib</a> that allows you to use maven2 from Ant. Why would you use Maven2 from Ant?<br><br><ul><li>because Maven2 requires to adapt your project to its standard hierarchy, or to have excellent Maven2 skills to create your own archetype for each existing project. </li><li>because everybody knows Ant, but Ant does not manage dependencies well. Maven2 Antlib can be used just for that: managing dependencies.</li></ul>I have to try that on a real project to see if it is really an easy and flexible approach, better than plain Maven2. <br><br></p>

      <p>A friend of mine had a good idea for a Java project named &ldquo;hibernate proxy&rdquo;. I renamed it &ldquo;hibernate network proxy&rdquo; because hibernate proxies are already a well known concept among hibernate users (it allows lazy loading through a Java Proxy class). <br> <br> The hibernate network proxy, is a way to use hibernate remotely, that is to proxy hibernate calls through TCP (or even HTTP) to another machine, that will execute the session.saveOrUpdate or the session.load, etc. calls and return the corresponding objects, serialize them and deserialize them for use on the client.<br> <br> As most projects in my company involves several distributed services, this idea could have been potentially very interesting, allowing hibernate use in several services that would interact with a common service in charge of the db. It made me think about other standard patterns:<br> <br> <ul>   <li>This is not very different from the classical EJB session facade architecture, except we don&rsquo;t expose application functionalities, only hibernate stuff. In fact we don&rsquo;t want to expose application functionalities since they are not shared between services.</li>   <li>This is very similar to Entity EJBs used without facade, remotely, the first kind of design we heard about when EJBs came out. This would actually be a good fit for doing this kind of stuff, amazingly. I never thought remote entity EJBs were of any real use. Unfortunately for our projects, we already have a messaging infrastructure, and I am not sure how feasible it is to change of EJB transport protocol. Seeing the complexity of something like IIOP, it looks like a dead end.</li>   <li>This is a kind of Hibernate Second Level Cache, a cache with remote capabilities. The cache would proxy the request to the db service, and the db service would answer to that. This is a possible implementation that seems very flexible.</li>   <li>Use a regular TCP connection to the DB, and hibernate in a standard way. Ok, it does not use our internal message bus, but it is so simple and standard.&nbsp;</li> </ul> The last solution raises the most important question: <br> <blockquote>Why does it need to be proxied?&nbsp;<br> </blockquote> To go through some particular port? -&gt; use a port forwarder.<br> To go through HTTP? -&gt; use HTTPTunnel.<br> You want Java only? -&gt; use <a  href="http://www.jcraft.com/jhttptunnel/">JHttpTunnel</a>,there is even JSch for ssh<br> <br> <br></p>

      <p>Until recently, I always found Eclipse CVS support to be excellent. The synchronize view was really a big plus to do clean commits, without forgetting any file.<br> <br> But I have encountered several problem with Eclipse 3.2+:<br> <br> <blockquote>On one project, it keeps putting the build directory into CVS, and I can&rsquo;t find how to change that setting. Each time I open the project I have to change the CVS/Entries file.<br>   <br> On another, where I have lots of files in, Eclipse delete some of the files (checked in CVS) regularly, although not often. It won&rsquo;t retrieve them back again from CVS. It seems to be the same files each time. I have no clue why.<br>   <br> The diff sometimes tells me the whole file has changed while there is absolutely no change.<br>   <br> I could not make the merge work. It kept on complaining about some parameters.<br>   <br> </blockquote> And now the workaround for all those cases: <br> <blockquote><b>The good old CVS command line.<br>   <br>   </b></blockquote> I never remember how do to a merge with the command line, so I each time go to google and read<a  href="http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/%7Ejdalbey/205/Resources/cvsBranchMerge.html"> this merge example page</a>. Here are the very simple steps if you are in a branch and want to merge:<br> <ol>   <li>     <pre>cvs update -A mypoem.txt (use head as local repository)</pre>   </li>   <li>     <pre class="source">cvs update -j release-1 (merge release-1 changes into local repository)</pre>   </li>   <li>     <pre class="source">cvs update mypoem.txt</pre>   </li>   <li>     <pre class="source">cvs commit mypoem.txt</pre>   </li> </ol> <br></p>

      <p>I am writing only as a newbie on Maven2. I tried to use it several times on small projects, but each time I found out that the time involved to make it work with an existing project was too much a pain in the a**. When confronted to very simple hierarchies that are not the standard of the documentation, I was a bit lost on how to arrange things, except changing the whole hierarchy to adapt to Maven.  <br><br>Also on small scale code, Maven requires you again to adapt your project to it and it will make your small code look like an important enterprise project. For example if you want to build a small test that can be executed as a server (with one particular class), as a client (with another class), or as a servlet, using one or two other common classes, Maven requires at least 3 source hierarchies (with src directory). <br><br>I think it is not only because I know ant (much) better that ant proved many times to be quite flexible, and I have never been on a project where switching from Makefile to ant was a problem. I am not an ant fan. I have a preference of code over XML that ends up here and there being like code, in a much less flexible way. However Ant, as I said, is flexible. One can always use the good old scripting languages (javascript, beanshell, etc.) to define new tasks, and therefore bypass any inflexibility of the original design. <br><br>Still Maven2 has plenty of very good stuff, especially for more normal projects. It provides versioning, central repository and dependency checking for you. It is probably a good idea to use it rather than bad ant scripts, or, even worse, old Makefiles. Also Maven2 hierarchy conventions are not stupid, it is just not fitted for quick and dirty stuff. <br><br><br></p>

      <p>One important feature of Java language is the package keyword. It helps a lot in modularizing your code. But how exactly one should use it is not that clear.<br /><br />I have been on projects where 100s of classes are in a same package and more often where you have packages for every 2 classes. Often, packages are chosen so as to split functionalities. But often as well, people are packages maniacs and create way too many of them, because they want to sort things out, not necessarily applying a consistent logic. For example, I am sure many of you have seen the &ldquo;blahblah.exceptions&rdquo; packages where you dump exceptions classes.<br /><br />Without any precise intention for packages, you encounter quickly cyclic dependencies in your project, and your build system becomes overly complicated. Then you try to remove cyclic dependencies, not by using the package keyword better, but by building jars differently (=ugly jars) and &ldquo;refactoring&rdquo; a bit.<br /><br />I fell myself in many of those traps. Fortunately I stumbled on my way on <a href="http://clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html">JDepend</a> package analysis program. At first I wondered why JDepend calculated dependencies between Java packages and not between Jars, as in your project what matters is jar interdependencies. After using it regularly, first for the fun of trying not to have cyclic dependencies in my Java packages - the green light effect (I wanted my green light on my project), I understood much better its interest. I now make Java packages that are much more meaningful. They not only separate functionalities, but also create excellent modularity. Building a project is very easy, reusing parts of it is very clear. If one needs to split a jar in a project, it&rsquo;s very clear how to split it (by Java packages). And I find that in the end my packages make much more sense.<br /><br />Placing a class in the right package is most of the time not difficult, especially for experienced programmers. But now and then, with JDepend, I find mistakes. Correcting those mistakes regularly, when it&rsquo;s just about one or two classes is quick and easy. Correcting them on a project where dependency analysis was never done is a nightmare.<br /><br />Now I don&rsquo;t really care about JDepend metrics about abstractness and instability so much, I did not find any good use of them. But <a href="http://clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html">JDepend</a> (or a package dependencies checker) really is an essential program for good Java development.</p>
