    <a href="https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/finite-difference-approximation-of-derivatives/">Finite Difference Approximation of Derivatives</a>
  </h1>
  <time datetime="2012-12-21T12:12:00Z" class="post-date">Fri, Dec 21, 2012</time>
  <p>A while ago, someone asked me to reference him in a paper of mine because I used formulas of a finite difference approximation of a derivative on a non uniform grid. I was shocked as those formula are very widespread (in countless papers, courses and books) and not far off elementary mathematics.</p>
<p>There are however some interesting old papers on the technique. Usually people approximate the first derivative by the central approximation of second order:</p>
<p>$$ f&rsquo;(x) = \frac{f(x_{i+1})-f(x_{i-1})}{x_{i+1} - x_{i-1}} $$</p>
<p>However there are some other possibilities. For example one can find a formula directly out of the Taylor expansions of \(f(x_{i+1})\) and \(f(x_{i-1})\). <a href="https://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nada.kth.se%2Fkurser%2Fkth%2F2D1263%2Fl6.pdf&amp;ei=q07QUNH8GuW80QW804GIAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGunxdXHqGsHh0czcX7e4gCnAU1WQ&amp;bvm=bv.1355534169,d.d2k">This paper</a> and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2153-3490.1970.tb01933.x/abstract">that one</a> seems to indicate it is more precise, especially when the grid does not vary smoothly (a typical example is uniform by parts).</p>
<p>This can make a big difference in practice, here is the example of a Bond priced under the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model by finite differences. EULER is the classic central approximation, EULER1 uses the more refined approximation based on Taylor expansion, EULER2 uses Taylor expansion approximation as well as a higher order boundary condition. I used the same parameters as in the Tavella-Randall book example and a uniform grid between [0, 0.2] except that I have added 2 points at the far end at 0.5 and 1.0. So the only difference between EULER and EULER1 lies in the computation of derivatives at the 3 last points.</p>
<figure><img src="/post/cir_bond_euler_discretizations.png"/>
</figure>

<p>I also computed the backward 2nd order first derivative on a non uniform grid (for the refined boundary). I was surprised not to find this easily on the web, so here it is:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
$$ f&rsquo;(x_i) = \left(\frac{1}{h_i}+\frac{1}{h_i+h_{i-1}}\right) f(x_i)- \left(\frac{1}{h_{i-1}}+\frac{1}{h_i}\right) f(x_{i-1})+ \left(\frac{1}{h_{i-1}} - \frac{1}{h_i+h_{i-1}} \right) f(x_{i-2}) + &hellip;$$</p>
<p>Incidently while writing this post I found out it was a pain to write Math in HTML (I initially used a picture). MathML seems a bit crazy, I wonder why they couldn&rsquo;t just use the LaTeX standard.</p>
<p><strong>Update January 3rd 2013</strong> - I now use <a href="http://mathjax.org">Mathjax</a>. It&rsquo;s not very good solution as I think this should typically be handled by the browser directly instead of huge javascript library, but it looks a bit better</p>

  <time datetime="2012-12-12T20:59:00Z" class="post-date">Wed, Dec 12, 2012</time>
   

I am comparing various finite difference schemes on simple problems and am currently stumbling upon a strange discontinuity at the boundary for some of the schemes (Crank-Nicolson, Rannacher, and TR-BDF2) when I plot an American Put Option Gamma using a log grid. It actually is more pronounced with some values of the strike, not all. The amplitude oscillates with the strike. And it does not happen on a European Put, so it's not a boundary approximation error in the code. It might well be due to the nature of the scheme as schemes based on implicit Euler work (maybe monotonicity preservation is important). This appears on this graph around S=350.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ugmThxi_c_g/UMjh4M8JKAI/AAAAAAAAGKg/Oj-p9_AaNzM/s1600/gamma_american_boundary.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="160" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ugmThxi_c_g/UMjh4M8JKAI/AAAAAAAAGKg/Oj-p9_AaNzM/s640/gamma_american_boundary.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><b>Update December 13, 2012</b>: after a close look at what was happening. It was after all a boundary issue. It's more visible on the American because the Gamma is more spread out. But I reproduced it on a European as well.

I spent quick a bit of time to figure out why something that is usually simple to do in Java did not work in Scala: Arrays and ArrayLists with generics.<br /><br />For some technical reason (type erasure at the JVM level), Array sometimes need a parameter with a ClassManifest !?! a generic type like [T :&lt; Point : ClassManifest] need to be declared instead of simply [T :&lt; Point].<br /><br />And then the quickSort method somehow does not work if invoked on a generic... like quickSort(points) where points: Array[T]. I could not figure out yet how to do this one, I just casted to points.asInstanceOf[Array[Point]], quite ugly.<br /><br />In contrast I did not even have to think much to write the Java equivalent. Generics in Scala, while having a nice syntax, are just crazy. This is something that goes beyond generics. Some of the Scala library and syntax is nice, but overall, the IDE integration is still very buggy, and productivity is not higher.<br /><br /><b>Update Dec 12 2012</b>: here is the actual code (this is kept close to the Java equivalent on purpose):<br /><pre>object Point {<br />  def sortAndRemoveIdenticalPoints[T <: Point : ClassManifest](points : Array[T]) : Array[T] = {<br />      Sorting.quickSort(points.asInstanceOf[Array[Point]])<br />      val l = new ArrayBuffer[T](points.length)<br />      var previous = points(0)<br />      l += points(0)<br />      for (i <- 1 until points.length) {<br />        if(math.abs(points(i).value - previous.value)< Epsilon.MACHINE_EPSILON_SQRT) {<br />          l += points(i)<br />        }<br />      }<br />      return l.toArray<br />    }<br />    return points<br />  }<br />}<br /><br />class Point(val value: Double, val isMiddle: Boolean) extends Ordered[Point] {<br />  def compare(that: Point): Int = {<br />    return math.signum(this.value - that.value).toInt<br />  }<br />}<br /><!-----><!--:--></-></:></pre>In Java one can just use Arrays.sort(points) if points is a T[]. And the method can work with a subclass of Point.

This will be a very technical post, I am not sure that it will be very understandable by people not familiar with the implied volatility surface.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Something one notices when computing an option price under local volatility using a PDE solver, is how different is the Delta from the standard Black-Scholes Delta, even though the price will be very close for a Vanilla option. In deed, the Finite difference grid will have a different local volatility at each point and the Delta will take into account a change in local volatility as well.</div><div><br /></div><div>But this finite-difference grid Delta is also different from a standard numerical Delta where one just move the initial spot up and down, and takes the difference of computed prices. The numerical Delta will eventually include a change in implied volatility, depending if the surface is sticky-strike (vol will stay constant) or sticky-delta (vol will change). So the numerical Delta produced with a sticky-strike surface will be the same as the standard Black-Scholes Delta. In reality, what happens is that the local volatility is different when the spot moves up, if we recompute it: it is not static. The finite difference solver computes Delta with a static local volatility. If we call twice the finite difference solver with a different initial spot, we will reproduce the correct Delta, that takes into account the dynamic of the implied volatility surface.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here how different it can be if the delta is computed from the grid (static local volatility) or numerically (dynamic local volatility) on an exotic trade:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WW8ZE7urDGE/ULdHKNe_VXI/AAAAAAAAGKQ/JQ5Rd7wQYkk/s1600/static_localvol.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="235" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WW8ZE7urDGE/ULdHKNe_VXI/AAAAAAAAGKQ/JQ5Rd7wQYkk/s320/static_localvol.png" width="320" /></a></div><div><br /><br />This is often why people assume the local volatility model is wrong, not consistent. It is wrong if we consider the local volatility surface as static to compute hedges.</div>

  <p>After too many upgrades of Ubuntu, and switching from Gnome to KDE and back, my Ubuntu system became behaving strangely in KDE: authorization issues, frequent crashes, pulseaudio and ardour problems. I decided to give another try to OpenSuse, as Linux makes it easy to switch system without losing too much time reinstalling the useful applications.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been only a few days, but I am pleasantly surprised with OpenSuse. It feels more polished than Kubuntu. I could not point out to a specific feature, but so far I have not had to fiddle with any configuration file, everything works well out of the box. Somehow Kubuntu always felt flaky, read to break at any moment, while OpenSuse feels solid. But they should consider changing the default font settings in KDE to take advantage properly of antialiasing and pretty fonts (it&rsquo;s only a few clicks away, but still the default is not the prettiest).</p>

  <p>Very interesting presentation from Murex about their GPU computing. Some points were:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPU demand for mostly exotics pricing and greeks</li>
<li>Local vol main model for EQD exotics. Local vol calibrated via PDE approach.</li>
<li>Markov functional model becoming main model for IRD.</li>
<li>Use of local regression instead of Longstaff Schwartz (or worse CVA like sim of sim).</li>
<li>philox RNG from DE Shaw. But the presenter does not seem to know RNGs  very well (recommended Brownian Bridge for Mersenne Twister!).</li>
<li>An important advantage of GPU is latency. Grid computing only improves throughput but not latency. GPU improves both.</li>

It's a bit incredible, but in 2012, some linux distros (like Fedora, or Kubuntu) still have trouble to have pretty fonts everywhere. I found a nice tip initially for Google Chrome but that seems to improve more than Chrome: create ~/.fonts.conf with the following:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">[match target="font"]</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; [edit name="autohint" mode="assign"]</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [bool]true[/bool]</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; [/edit]</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; [edit name="hinting" mode="assign"]</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [bool]true[/bool]</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; [/edit]</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; [edit mode="assign" name="hintstyle"]</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [const]hintslight[/const]</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; [/edit]</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">[/match]</span><br /><div><br /></div><div>replace [ and ] with brackets &lt; and &gt;<br /><br />Update from 2013 - This can be done system wide, see <a href="http://chasethedevil.blogspot.com/2013/08/better-fonts-in-fedora-than-in-ubuntu.html">http://chasethedevil.blogspot.com/2013/08/better-fonts-in-fedora-than-in-ubuntu.html</a> </div><pre></pre>

I had the bad idea to upgrade to the beta Ubuntu 12.10. Something awfully broke in the upgrade. After too much struggling with apt-get &amp; dpkg, I decided to install Fedora 17.<br /><br />Strangely Fedora feels much faster than Ubuntu 12.04 (the boot time especially). Yum seems also faster than apt-get, especially the update part. Also while the Unity dock is not bad (better than gnome shell dock), the Unity dash thing just makes me crazy, the gnome shell activities, while close, are much easier to use.<br /><br />But it needs a bit more steps to install, although I had no problem to install <a href="http://www.if-not-true-then-false.com/2012/fedora-17-nvidia-guide/">nvidia drivers</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://obiee2go.blogspot.fr/2012/06/oracle-11g-oracle-database-11g.html">Oracle 11g xe</a>, Java, MP3, nice fonts, nice icons thanks to the guides <a href="http://www.mjmwired.net/resources/mjm-fedora-f17.html">here</a> and <a href="http://smashingweb.info/fedora-17-post-installation-guide-things-to-do-after-installing-fedora-17/">there</a>. SSD Trim instructions are the same (basically use "discard" instead of "default" in /etc/fstab). I have the most troubles with Oracle: somehow the start script does not work and I currently log in as "oracle" and start&nbsp;/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/config/scripts/startdb.sh from there (after having added the proper .bashrc for this user)<br /><br />I even managed the peculiarities of my laptop a similar way as ubuntu: I want Nvidia card when plugged in to a monitor (to be able to use it) and Intel card when not (to be able to use the LCD screen). My solution is to use the boot screen (in reality one just need to restart X11): this amounted to add a "hdmi" in "/etc/grub.d/40_custom" and creating a link to "/etc/rc3.d/S10DriverSelect" the following script (a dirty hack):<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">#!/bin/sh</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">if grep -q hdmi /proc/cmdline</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">then</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">&nbsp; if [ -d /usr/lib64/xorg/modules.bak/extensions/nvidia ];</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">&nbsp; then&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; cp -f /etc/X11/xorg.conf.hdmi /etc/X11/xorg.conf</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; mv /usr/lib64/xorg/modules.bak/extensions/nvidia /usr/lib64/xorg/modules/extensions/</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">&nbsp; fi</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">else</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">&nbsp; if [ -d /usr/lib64/xorg/modules/extensions/nvidia ];</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">&nbsp; then</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; cp -f /etc/X11/xorg.conf.intel /etc/X11/xorg.conf</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; mv /usr/lib64/xorg/modules/extensions/nvidia /usr/lib64/xorg/modules.bak/extensions/</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">&nbsp; fi</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;">fi</span><br /><br />Linux distros are really becoming closer in terms of configuration, LSB has made great progress.<br /><div><br />Edit from November 29: After a few weeks, I noticed that the system was quite unstable unfortunately. As a result, I moved back to Ubuntu on my laptop. I am running OpenSuse on my home computer. 1 year later, I am back to Fedora 19, 20 on my desktop - no stability issue, I prefer Gnome over KDE. </div>

How many reports have you had to fill up with a number of stars to choose? How much useless time is spent on figuring the this number just because it is always very ambiguous?<br /><br />Some blogger wrote an interesting entry on <a href="http://davidcelis.com/blog/2012/02/01/why-i-hate-five-star-ratings/">Why I Hate Five Stars Reviews</a>. Basically he advocates binary voting instead via like/dislike. Maybe a ternary system via like/dislike/don't care would be ok too.<br /><br />One coworker used to advocate the same for a similar reason: people reading those reports only pay attention to the extremes: the 5 stars or the 0 stars. So if you want to have a voice, you need to express it via 5 or 0, nothing in between.<br /><br /><br />

  <p>These days the expression &ldquo;move the needle&rdquo; is popular where I work. I did not know it was an expression of Steve Jobs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The company starts valuing the great salesmen, because they’re the  ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and  designers. So the salespeople end up running the company&hellip; Then the  product guys don’t matter so much, and a lot of them just turn off. It  happened at Apple when John Sculley came in, which was my fault, and  it happened when Ballmer took over at Microsoft. Apple was lucky and it  rebounded, but I don’t think anything will change at Microsoft as long  as Ballmer is running it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from the biography, just saw that in an interesting article about Microsoft problems:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2012/08/microsoft-lost-mojo-steve-ballmer?mbid=social_retweet">http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2012/08/microsoft-lost-mojo-steve-ballmer?mbid=social_retweet</a></p>
<p>I would not take those words literally: I have seen a company with the inverse problem: developping technical stuff for the sake of it, without a connection to what the market (or the users) are really after.</p>
<p>In the case of Apple, the engineers and designers actually know quite well what the market is after, maybe more so than the salespeople. But it is unfortunately not the case in every company. Still the case of people turning off because it is too hard to convince the hierarchy is probably quite common.</p>
