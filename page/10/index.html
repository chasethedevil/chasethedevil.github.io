C. Reisinger kindly pointed out to me <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.5487">this paper around square root Crank-Nicolson</a>. The idea is to apply a square root of time transformation to the PDE, and discretize the resulting PDE with Crank-Nicolson. Two reasons come to mind to try this: <br /><ul><li>the square root transform will result in small steps initially, where the solution is potentially not so smooth, making Crank-Nicolson behave better.</li><li>&nbsp;it is the natural time of the Brownian motion.</li></ul>Interestingly, it has nicer properties than what those reasons may suggest. On the Fokker-Planck density PDE, it does not oscillate under some very mild conditions and <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2605160">preserves density positivity at the peak</a>.<br /><br />Out of curiosity I tried it to price a one touch barrier option. Of course there is an analytical solution in my test case (Black-Scholes assumptions), but as soon as rates are assumed not constant or local volatility is used, there is no other solution than a numerical method. In the later case, finite difference methods are quite good in terms of performance vs accuracy.<br /><br />The classic Crank-Nicolson gives a reasonable price, but the strong oscillations near the barrier, at every time step are not very comforting.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XNr7vE77Dfo/VYQoBELx2KI/AAAAAAAAICw/FVVYrehW39Y/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2015-06-19%2B16%253A24%253A59.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="337" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XNr7vE77Dfo/VYQoBELx2KI/AAAAAAAAICw/FVVYrehW39Y/s640/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2015-06-19%2B16%253A24%253A59.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Crank-Nicolson Prices near the Barrier.

Each line is a different time.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />As a comparison, the TR-BDF2 scheme does relatively well: oscillations are removed after the second step, even with the extreme ratio of time steps vs space steps used on this example so that illustrations are clearer - Crank-Nicolson would still oscillate a lot with 10 times less space steps but we would not see oscillation on the square root Crank-Nicolson and a very mild one on TR-BDF2.<br /><br />The LMG2 scheme (a local richardson extrapolation) does not oscillate at all on this problem but is the slowest:<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HTxKtzO8au4/VYQo8t-wkdI/AAAAAAAAIDI/oPOjJWs0SI0/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2015-06-19%2B16%253A25%253A53.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="338" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HTxKtzO8au4/VYQo8t-wkdI/AAAAAAAAIDI/oPOjJWs0SI0/s640/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2015-06-19%2B16%253A25%253A53.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">LMG2 Prices near the Barrier.

It can however not be applied to that many problems in practice, as often some grid times are imposed by the payoff to evaluate, for example in a case of a discrete weekly barrier. But for continuous time problems (density PDE, Vanilla, American, continuous barriers) it's quite good.<br /><br />In reality, with a continuous barrier, the payoff is not discontinuous at every step, but it is only discontinuous at the first step.

Here are the main steps of Hagan derivation. Let's recall his notation for the SABR model where typically, \\(C(F) = F^\beta\\)

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uq2IhJPDd7M/VUzC4Hh3xoI/AAAAAAAAH9k/sY034iAD38Y/s1600/Screenshot_2015-05-08_16-04-27.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uq2IhJPDd7M/VUzC4Hh3xoI/AAAAAAAAH9k/sY034iAD38Y/s1600/Screenshot_2015-05-08_16-04-27.png" /></a></div>First, he defines the moments of stochastic volatility:

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--wj3nYsi9g8/VUzE5glQ0VI/AAAAAAAAH98/NlVSXIc2NDI/s1600/Screenshot_2015-05-08_16-13-32.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="107" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--wj3nYsi9g8/VUzE5glQ0VI/AAAAAAAAH98/NlVSXIc2NDI/s320/Screenshot_2015-05-08_16-13-32.png" width="320" /></a></div>It turns out that there is a magical symmetry for k=0 and k=2.
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OStv8D0OSw0/VUzGJ6HKqDI/AAAAAAAAH-Y/jk85U57eHnY/s1600/Screenshot_2015-05-08_16-19-45.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="32" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OStv8D0OSw0/VUzGJ6HKqDI/AAAAAAAAH-Y/jk85U57eHnY/s320/Screenshot_2015-05-08_16-19-45.png" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-67k-xTphi7Q/VUzGJwbwSWI/AAAAAAAAH-U/Faz235QNpKs/s1600/Screenshot_2015-05-08_16-20-09.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="32" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-67k-xTphi7Q/VUzGJwbwSWI/AAAAAAAAH-U/Faz235QNpKs/s320/Screenshot_2015-05-08_16-20-09.png" width="320" /></a></div>Note that in the second equation, the second derivative applies to the whole.
Because of this, he can express \\(Q^{(2)}\\) in terms of \\(Q^{(0)}\\):
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-k-3DQd9MuIQ/VUzHl5TSuAI/AAAAAAAAH-s/CjTFtlX4upw/s1600/Screenshot_2015-05-08_16-25-36.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="29" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-k-3DQd9MuIQ/VUzHl5TSuAI/AAAAAAAAH-s/CjTFtlX4upw/s320/Screenshot_2015-05-08_16-25-36.png" width="320" /></a></div>And he plugs that back to the integrated Fokker-Planck equation to obtain the arbitrage free SABR PDE:
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aEwTOxulsWI/VUzHl3qfZAI/AAAAAAAAH-o/qQZPb8Vvz7o/s1600/Screenshot_2015-05-08_16-25-48.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="29" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aEwTOxulsWI/VUzHl3qfZAI/AAAAAAAAH-o/qQZPb8Vvz7o/s320/Screenshot_2015-05-08_16-25-48.png" width="320" /></a></div>
There is a simple more common explanation in the world of local stochastic volatility for what's going on. For example, in the particle method paper from Guyon-Labordère, we have the following expression for the true local volatility.
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uV792mNz4Xo/Ul6baEs2ktI/AAAAAAAAG1U/8Iv1i23oXok/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2013-10-16%2B15%3A51%3A46.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="127" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uV792mNz4Xo/Ul6baEs2ktI/AAAAAAAAG1U/8Iv1i23oXok/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2013-10-16%2B15%3A51%3A46.png" width="320" /></a></div>


<p>In the first equation, the numerator is simply \(Q^{(2)}\) and the denominator \(Q^{(0)}\). Of course, the integrated Fokker-Planck equation can be rewritten as:</p>
<p>$$ Q^{(0)}_T = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon^2 \left[C^2(F) \frac{Q^{(2)}}{Q^{(0)}} Q^{(0)}\right]_{FF} $$</p>
<p>Karlsmark uses that approach directly in his thesis, using the expansions of Doust for \(Q^{(k)}\). Looking a Doust expansions, the fraction reduces straightforwardly to the same expression as Hagan, and the symmetry in the equations appears a bit less coincidental.</p>

  </h1>
  <time datetime="2015-04-30T17:16:00Z" class="post-date">Thu, Apr 30, 2015</time>
  <p>I looked nearly two years ago already at <a href="/post/sabr-with-new-hagan-pde-approach">the arbitrage free SABR of Andreasen-Huge in comparison to the arbitrage free PDE of Hagan</a> and showed how close the <a href="/post/arbitrage-free-sabr---another-view-on-hagan-approach">ideas were</a>: Andreasen-Huge relies on the normal Dupire forward PDE using a slightly simpler local vol (no time dependent exponential term) while Hagan works directly on the Fokker-Planck PDE (you can think of it as the Dupire Forward PDE for the density) and uses an expansion of same order as the original SABR formula (which leads to an additional exponential term in the local volatility).</p>
<p>One clever idea from Andreasen-Huge is the use of a single step. It turns out that their idea is not completely new. Daniel Duffy sent me some old papers from Shishkin around fitted schemes (<a href="http://oai.cwi.nl/oai/asset/10209/10209A.pdf">here is one</a>). This is very much the same thing, except Shishkin concern is about a good handling of discontinuity in the initial condition, and therefore makes the association step function =&gt; cumulative density to fit the diffusion parameter. Andreasen-Huge work directly with the call prices as this is what they solve.</p>
<p>One drawback of Andreasen-Huge one step method is the inability to match the standard SABR smile: the parameters don&rsquo;t have exactly the same meaning. It turns out that by just shifting proportionally the local volatility by a constant factor, Andreasen Huge matches Hagan PDE vols quite closely.</p>

<p>While this is interesting in itself, it&rsquo;s still not so simple to backup this factor without solving for it (and then the method looses appeal).</p>

  <p>A few recent programming languages sparked my interest:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a> because of the wide coverage of mathematical functions, and great attention to quality of the implementations. It has also some interesting web interface.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dartlang.org">Dart</a>: because it&rsquo;s a language focused purely on building apps for the web, and has a supposedly good VM.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>: it&rsquo;s the latest fad. It has interesting concepts around concurrency and a focus on being low level all the while being simpler than C.</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided to see how well suited they would be on a simple Monte-Carlo simulation of a forward start option under the Black model. I am no expert at all in any of the languages, so this is a beginner&rsquo;s test. I compared the runtime for executing 16K simulations times a multiplier.</p>

<p><strong>About performance</strong></p>
<p>I am quite impressed at Dart performance versus Scala (or vs. Java, as it has the same performance as Scala) given that it is much less strict about types and its focus is not at all on this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Julia performance is great, that is if one is careful about types. Julia is very <a href="http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/manual/performance-tips/#man-performance-tips">finicky about casting and optimizations</a>, fortunately @time helps spotting the issues (often an inefficient cast will lead to copy and thus high allocation). JuliaA is my first attempt, with an implicit badly performing conversion of MersenneTwister to AbstractRNG. It is slower first, as the JIT costs is reflected on the first run, very much like in Java (although it appears to be even worse).</p>
<p>Rust is the most impressive. I had to add the &ndash;release flag to the cargo build tool to produce a properly optimized binary, otherwise the performance is up to 7x worse.&lt;</p>

<p>My Python code is not vectorized, just like any of the other implementations. While the code looks relatively clean, I made the most errors compared to Julia or Scala. Python numpy isn&rsquo;t always great: norm.ppf is very slow, slower than my hand coded python implementation of AS241.</p>
<p>Dart does not have fixed arrays: everything is a list. It also does not have strict 64 bit int: they can be arbitrarily large. The dev environment is ok but not great.</p>
<p>Julia is a bit funny, not very OO (no object method) but more functional, although many OO concepts are there (type inheritence, type constructors). It was relatively straightforward, although I do not find intuitive the type conversion issues (eventual copy on conversion).</p>
<p>Rust took me the most time to write, as it has quite new concepts around mutable variables, and &ldquo;pointers&rdquo; scope. I relied on an existing MersenneTwister64 that worked with latest Rust. It was a bit disappointing to see that some dSFMT git project did not compile with the latest Rust, likely because Rust is still a bit too young. This does not sound so positive, but I found it to be the language the most interesting to learn.</p>
<p>I was familiar with Scala before this exercise. I used a non functional approach, with while loops in order to make sure I had maximum performance. This is something I find a bit annoying in Scala, I always wonder if for performance I need to do a while instead of a for, when the classic for makes much more sense (that and the fact that the classic for leads to some annoying delegation in runtime errors/on debug).</p>
<p>I relied on the default RNG for Dart but MersenneTwister for Scala, Julia, Python, Rust. All implementations use a hand coded AS241 for the inverse cumulative normal.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>Using FastMath.exp instead of Math.exp leads a slightly better performance for Scala:</p>

    <a href="https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/volatility-swap-vs-variance-swap-replication---truncation/">Volatility Swap vs Variance Swap Replication - Truncation</a>
  </h1>
  <time datetime="2015-03-16T14:39:00Z" class="post-date">Mon, Mar 16, 2015</time>
  <p>I have looked at <a href="/post/jumps-impact-variance-swap-vs-volatility-swap/">jump effects on volatility vs. variance swaps</a>. There is a similar behavior on tail events, that is, on truncating the replication. One main <a href="/post/variance-swap-replication--discrete-or-continuous">problem with discrete replication of variance swaps</a> is the implicit domain truncation, mainly because the variance swap equivalent log payoff is far from being linear in the wings. The equivalent payoff with Carr-Lee for a volatility swap is much more linear in the wings (<a href="/post/a-volatility-swap-and-a-straddle">not so far of a straddle</a>). So we could expect the replication to be less sensitive to the wings truncation.
I have done a simple test on flat 40% volatility:</p>

</figure>
</p>
<p>As expected, the vol swap is much less sensitive, and interestingly, very much like for the jumps, it moves in the opposite direction: the truncated price is higher than the non truncated price.</p>

<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2557046">Antonov et al.</a> present an interesting view on SABR with negative rates: instead of relying on a shifted SABR to allow negative rates up to a somewhat arbitrary shift, they modify slightly the SABR model to allow negative rates directly:
$$ dF_t = |F_t|^\beta v_t dW_F $$
with \\( v\_t \\) being the standard lognormal volatility process of SABR.<br /><br />Furthermore they derive a clever semi-analytical approximation for this model, based on low correlation, quite close to the Monte-Carlo prices in their tests. It's however not clear if it is arbitrage-free.<br /><br />It turns out that it is easy to tweak Hagan SABR PDE approach to this "absolute SABR" model: one just needs to push the boundary \\(F\_{min}\\) far away, and to use the absolute value in C(F).<br /><br />It then reproduces the same behavior as in Antonov et al. paper:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kKiSIo-QgAg/VQBp3sRtYFI/AAAAAAAAH34/_A9DKmA_n-E/s1600/Screenshot%2B-%2B03112015%2B-%2B05%3A13%3A45%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kKiSIo-QgAg/VQBp3sRtYFI/AAAAAAAAH34/_A9DKmA_n-E/s1600/Screenshot%2B-%2B03112015%2B-%2B05%3A13%3A45%2BPM.png" height="191" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"Absolute SABR" arbitrage free PDE</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cRLZged_Ees/VQBp7sKKTrI/AAAAAAAAH4A/PIZbUBBHP1I/s1600/Screenshot%2B-%2B03112015%2B-%2B05%3A14%3A02%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cRLZged_Ees/VQBp7sKKTrI/AAAAAAAAH4A/PIZbUBBHP1I/s1600/Screenshot%2B-%2B03112015%2B-%2B05%3A14%3A02%2BPM.png" height="250" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Antonov et al. graph</td></tr></tbody></table>&nbsp;I obtain a higher spike, it would look much more like Antonov graph had I used a lower resolution to compute the density: the spike would be smoothed out.<br /><br />Interestingly, the arbitrage free PDE will also work for high beta (larger than 0.5):<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YngRqD1ilNw/VQBroKrwKWI/AAAAAAAAH4M/3h9N7zHVjx0/s1600/Screenshot%2B-%2B03112015%2B-%2B05%3A21%3A13%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YngRqD1ilNw/VQBroKrwKWI/AAAAAAAAH4M/3h9N7zHVjx0/s1600/Screenshot%2B-%2B03112015%2B-%2B05%3A21%3A13%2BPM.png" height="190" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">beta = 0.75</td></tr></tbody></table>It turns out to be then nearly the same as the absorbing SABR, even if prices can cross a little the 0.

There is very little information on variance swaps on a foreign asset. There can be two kinds of contracts:<br /><ul><li>one that pays the foreign variance in a domestic currency, this is a quanto contract as the exchange rate is implicitly fixed.</li><li>one that pays the foreign variance, multiplied by the fx rate at maturity. This is a flexo contract, and is just about buying a variance swap from a foreign bank. The price of such a contract today is very simple, just the standard variance swap price multiplied by the fx rate today (change of measure).</li></ul>For quanto contracts, it's not so obvious a priori. If we consider a stochastic volatility model for the asset, the replication formula will not be applicable directly as the stochastic volatility will appear in the quanto drift correction. Furthermore, vanilla quanto option prices can not be computed simply as under Black-Scholes, a knowledge of the underlying model is necessary.<br /><br />Interestingly, under the Schobel-Zhu model, it is simple to fit an analytic formula for the quanto variance swap. The standard variance swap price is:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gfq9trxBHhg/VOxxHi0khTI/AAAAAAAAH00/xD8NbXUSJls/s1600/Screenshot%2B-%2B230215%2B-%2B19%3A33%3A17.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gfq9trxBHhg/VOxxHi0khTI/AAAAAAAAH00/xD8NbXUSJls/s1600/Screenshot%2B-%2B230215%2B-%2B19%3A33%3A17.png" height="50" width="400" /></a></div>The quanto variance swap can be priced with the same formula using a slightly different theta:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OwYg8Hs9qRw/VOxxMe-iifI/AAAAAAAAH08/xBeV56UEGV8/s1600/Screenshot%2B-%2B230215%2B-%2B19%3A34%3A06.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OwYg8Hs9qRw/VOxxMe-iifI/AAAAAAAAH08/xBeV56UEGV8/s1600/Screenshot%2B-%2B230215%2B-%2B19%3A34%3A06.png" /></a></div><br />We can use it to assess the accuracy of a naive quanto option replication where we use the ATM quanto forward instead of the forward in the variance swap replication formula.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ate0oZ41eoY/VOxxhwqGI_I/AAAAAAAAH1E/6LRgNiAHCJg/s1600/Screenshot%2B-%2B230215%2B-%2B19%3A34%3A52.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ate0oZ41eoY/VOxxhwqGI_I/AAAAAAAAH1E/6LRgNiAHCJg/s1600/Screenshot%2B-%2B230215%2B-%2B19%3A34%3A52.png" height="289" width="640" /></a></div><br />Interestingly, the&nbsp; quanto forward approximation turns out to be very accurate and the correction is important. The price without correction is the price with zero correlation, and we see it can be +/-5% off in this case.<br /><br />The local vol price seems a bit off, I am not sure exactly why. It could be due the discretization, the theoretical variance should be divided by (N-1) but here we divide by N where N is the number of observations. That would still lead to a skewed price but better centered around correlation 0.<br /><br />It's also a bit surprising that local vol is worse than the simpler ATM quanto forward approximation: it seems that it's extracting the wrong information to do a more precise quanto correction, likely related to the shift of stochastic volatility under the domestic measure.

<p>Beside <a href="/post/variance-swap-replication--discrete-or-continuous">the problem with the discreteness</a> of the replication, variance swaps are sensitive to jumps. This is an often mentioned reason for the collapse of the single name variance swap market in 2008 as jumps are more likely on single name equities.</p>
<p>Those graphs are the result of Monte-Carlo simulations with various jump sizes using the Bates model, and using Local Volatility implied from the Bates vanilla prices. The local volatility price will be the same price as per static replication for the variance swap, and we can see it they converge when there is no jump.</p>
<p>The presence of jumps lead to a theoretically higher variance swap price, again, which we miss completely with the static replication. As jumps go higher, the difference is more pronounced.</p>
<p>Volatility swaps are a bit better behaved in this regard. Interestingly, local volatility overestimate the value in this case (which for variance swaps it underestimates the value). I also noticed that the relatively <a href="/post/a-volatility-swap-a-and-straddle">recent formula from Carr-Lee</a> will underestimate jumps even more so than local volatility: it is more precise in the absence of jumps, very close to Heston, but less precise than local volatility when jumps increase in size.</p>
<p>I have added a small section around this in <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2567398">my paper on SSRN</a>.</p>

People regularly believe that Variance swaps need to be priced by discrete replication, because the market trades only a discrete set of options.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9dEW7QRFa7k/VOYguM8BHOI/AAAAAAAAH0Q/RPFxCeyq6nU/s1600/Screenshot%2B-%2B190215%2B-%2B18%3A36%3A26.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9dEW7QRFa7k/VOYguM8BHOI/AAAAAAAAH0Q/RPFxCeyq6nU/s1600/Screenshot%2B-%2B190215%2B-%2B18%3A36%3A26.png" height="340" width="640" /></a></div><br />In reality, a discrete replication will misrepresent the tail, and can be quite arbitrary. It looks like the discrete replication as described in <a href="http://bfi.cl/papers/Derman%201999%20-%20More%20about%20Variance%20Swaps.pdf">Derman Goldman Sachs paper</a> is in everybody's mind, probably because it's easy to grasp. Strangely, it looks like most forget the section "Practical problems with replication" on p27 of his paper, where you can understand that discrete replication is not all that practical.<br /><br />Reflecting on all of this, I noticed it was possible to create more accurate discrete replications easily, and that those can have vastly different hedging weights. It is a much better idea to just replicate the log payoff continuously with a decent model for interpolation and extrapolation and imply the hedge from the greeks.<br /><br />I wrote <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2567398">a small paper around this here</a>.

  <p>It&rsquo;s quite incredible that Gnome 3.0 was almost an identical mess as KDE 4.0 had been a year or two earlier. Both are much better now, more stable, but both also still have their issues, and don&rsquo;t feel like a real improvement over Gnome 2.0 or KDE 3.5.</p>
<p>Now the main file manager for Gnome 3.0, Nautilus has buttons with nearly identical icons that mean vastly different things, one is a menu, the other is a list view. Also it does not integrate with other desktops well from a look and feel perpective, here is a screenshot under XFCE (KDE would not look better).The push for window buttons inside the toolbar makes for a funny looking window. In Gnome Shell, it&rsquo;s not much better, plus there are some windows with a dark theme and some with a standard theme all mixed together.</p>
<p>On the left is Caja: an updated GTK 2.0 version of Nautilus. I find it more functional, I don&rsquo;t really understand the push to remove most options from the screen in Gnome 3.0. The only positive thing I can see on for the new Nautilus, is the grey color for the left side, which looks more readable and polished.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Nautilus within Ubuntu Unity feels better, it has a real menu and standard looking window. I suppose they customized it quite a bit.

When it comes to HiDPI support, Gnome shell is often touted has having one of the best. Well maybe for laptop screens, but certainly not for larger screens, where it just double everything and everything just looks too big. XFCE is actually decent on HiDPI screens.</p>
