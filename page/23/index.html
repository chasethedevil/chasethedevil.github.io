      <p>I tried <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox 3</a> twice before, while it was in alpha and beta. I was not impressed at all, it seemed buggy (normal for alpha) and I found the new location bar behavior unintuitive. It did not seem that much faster either. So I always quickly went back to Firefox 2.<br /><br />I tried again recently, funnily, because of a bad Kernel update. One day, after a kernel update, my laptop started to run only at a max of 800Mhz, I did not notice it immediately. I thought wow Firefox 2.0 is really slow with gmail, maybe I should try Firefox 3 again. I did and worked a few days without noticing the processor speed difference that much. Firefox 3 at 800Mhz is as fast as Firefox 2.0 at 2Ghz. It is only after struggling with very long compilation time related to my work that I thought something was wrong.<br /><br />As usual with Linux troubles, solution are strange but not too hard to find out. I just had to add a <span style="font-family: Courier; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">processor.ignore_ppc=1</span> kernel parameter for the kernel to behave properly again.<br /><br />Yesterday I installed Firefox 3 on a MacBook, and I was really impressed by its speed. I felt faster than Safari. And now I got used to the new location bar behavior, I would not go back (I think the behavior improved after the betas as well).<br /><br />Another interesting browser these days, especially for bloggers, is Flock 2 (based on Firefox 3).</p>

      </span>
      
      <p>I finally took some time to try <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google AppEngine</a>. It used to be easy to find free PHP hosting around 2000. It became a rarity. So writing small experiments for free on the web was difficult. Experiments are back thanks to Google with their AppEngine. Many aspects of it are quite interesting and show where they focus.<br /><br />First it is all Python. It makes sense as I believe Guido v Rossum, Python creator, works for Google. Some people believe in a future Java application hosting. I don&rsquo;t see any reason why it could not become a reality. Making something like AppEngine is a big task, changing implementation language is not. In the meantime, it is not an excuse not to try it, as the Python standard library is fairly rich and Google provides additional libraries on top of it.<br /><br />AppEngine offers the basic bricks for building web apps:<br /><ul><li>Persistence: they rolled out their own persistence layer. Is it because it is stored in BigTable? It is quite basic (no join), maybe again for the same reason. Still it is enough to write prototypes or do fun stuff.</li><li>View: one can use Django templates. They are not perfect but better done than what we have in the java world for templating.</li><li>Authentication: Google provide their authentication system transparently. It is amazingly simple to setup authenticated sites/pages.</li><li>URL Fetch: points toward service oriented architecture. Without it, making services and calling them would not be possible.</li><li>Other useful stuff like Mail, cache.<br /></li></ul><br />With such a list of libraries, one can easily imagine the server side of future apps for Android running on AppEngine.<br /><br />The way code updates are pushed to the google servers is a bit reminiscent of Java web application deployment. However it is done with much finer granularity (file).<br /><br />Overall I am happy with AppEngine. Yes it is similar to old PHP hosting, but  it adds a lot of value by bringing few easy to use libraries, and natural integration with Google infrastructure. Compared to a PHP hosting, I think the biggest improvement is the database (dev use and admin use). For the dev it is integrated to the code. For the admin, it can be done transparently on the web. The most interesting is that it&rsquo;s FREE.</p>

      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Option, Futures and Other Derivatives</span> is by far the most popular book in finance. You will find it in every finance company, on many desks.<br /><br />It is a very good introduction for people not familiar with standard financial products. This kind of book is unavoidable to understand the basis. It goes also beyond with the chapters on pricing and hedging. These 2 chapters make one understand many other book. If one understands the Black and Scholze formula, one can easily approach many other pricing formula, as in a way, there are all similar in their approach.</p>

      <p>If one has to learn about equity derivatives, beside the classic <a href="http://chasethedevil.blogspot.com/2008/06/option-futures-and-other-derivatives.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Option, Futures and Other Derivatives</span></a> from Hull, <span style="font-style: italic;">Structured Equity Derivatives</span> by Harry M Kat is a must read.<br /><br />His ideas are presented in a software developer friendly way, as his goal is to show how different equity derivatives products are behind the scenes, very similar.<br /><br />I enjoyed the variety of exotic products presented and the very detailed way in which they are explained.<br /><br />The book is filled up with graphs, which is a good thing. While browsing the book for the first time, I did not really grasp those graphs well. But after having read it, they do make sense and help visualize what&rsquo;s happening. With those graphs, volatility and other parameters don&rsquo;t look only like abstract variables in a formula.</p>

      <p>It took me a long time to have the Apple Bluetooth Keyboard (slim aluminium model) working well with Fedora 9. Thanks to the Ubuntu documentation, it is quite easy to establish a connection manually through hidd commands. It was unfortunately much more difficult to have it automatically recognized and not disconnected after a few minutes without use.<br /><br />The following configuration should work with any other distro and probably other bluetooth keyboards as well.<br /><br />2 configurations files need to be updated to make it work:<br /><ul><li>/etc/default/bluetooth should contain the following, with the mac address replaced by the one from your keyboard (hidd &ndash;search to see it).<br /></li></ul><span style="font-family:courier new;"><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:courier new;">BLUETOOTH_ENABLED=1</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">HIDD_ENABLED=1</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">HIDD_OPTIONS=&ldquo;&ndash;timeout 8 &ndash;connect 00:1D:4F:A7:15:CC &ndash;server&rdquo;</span></span><br /></span><br /><ul><li>/etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf should be appended with<br /></li></ul><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:courier new;">device 00:1D:4F:A7:15:CC {</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">        name &ldquo;Apple Wireless Keyboard&rdquo;;</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">        auth enable;</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">        encrypt enable;</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">        lm master;</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">}</span></span><br /><br />The 2 tricky parameters are &ldquo;lm master&rdquo; (makes it connect automatically), and &ldquo;&ndash;timeout 8&rdquo; that makes it not disconnect contrary to what the option tells. Without the option the timeout of the keyboard is about 11 minutes. If the computer timeout is lower, the connection will be reestablished automatically, thus the value of 8.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Jun 16th update</span>: I still had disconnections, the only way I found to get rid of them was to <a href="http://kernel.ubuntu.com/git?p=ubuntu/ubuntu-hardy.git;a=blobdiff;f=net/bluetooth/hidp/core.c;h=dfaef02ba7b49f9503b6ae796090b39f6cc59a08;hp=42dd2b972cbe630acbedfefc334263b07aeac60b;hb=3923c54f44b4e8d31118b8a8b096cc85013d859f;hpb=97ea54575ec58a5bcf13ccf20556f4e68d961bf1">patch the kernel</a>.

      </span>
      
      <p>A friend of mine recently noticed that the good old DecimalFormat class is &ldquo;broken&rdquo;. If you try to parse a string that is not a number but is starting with a number, the DecimalFormat.parse will return what it managed to parse.<br /><br />The correct behavior should be to throw a parse exception IMHO. Judging from an old post in the Sun bug tracker, The folks at Sun don&rsquo;t think it really is, they call the default mode of parsing the &ldquo;lenient&rdquo; mode. It accepts bad inputs. Then why throwing ParseException at all and why not return 0/NaN when the first character is not a number? Why accepting <span style="font-family: courier new;">1toto2</span> as a number and not <span style="font-family: courier new;">toto2</span>?<br /><br />In reality it can really create unexpected problems. For example, in France,<span style="font-family: courier new;"> 0.1</span> is <span style="font-family: courier new;">0,1</span> because of the Locale conventions. If a user enters<span style="font-family: courier new;"> 0.1</span> in a French Locale, a method using DecimalFormat.parse will interpret it as <span style="font-family: courier new;">0</span> without throwing any exception.<br /><br />Note that DateFormat does not have that problem, at one point Sun added setLenient flag to be able to be in non Lenient mode. It would be very simple to do it with DecimalFormat, I did it myself as an exercise. In DecimalFormat.subparse, the 2 last break statements should stop processing in lenient mode. Lines 1528 to 1531:<br /><span style="font-size:85%;"> <span style="font-family: courier new;">                        sawExponent = true;</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                    }</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                    break; // Whether we fail or succeed, we exit this loop</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                }</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                else {</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                    break;</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                }</span></span><br /> become:<br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                         sawExponent = true;</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                    } else {</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                        if (isLenient()) {</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                            parsePosition.index = oldStart;</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                            parsePosition.index = oldStart;</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                            return false;</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                        }</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                    }</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                    break; // we succeed, we exit this loop</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                    </span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                }</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                else {</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                    if (isLenient()) {</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                        parsePosition.index = oldStart;</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                        parsePosition.errorIndex = oldStart;</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                        return false;</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                    }</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                    break;</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">                }</span></span></p>

      <p>I have forgotten a few libraries in my <a href="http://chasethedevil.blogspot.com/2008/04/better-java-swing-development.html">Better Swing Development</a> article, and notably <a href="http://www.miglayout.com">MiGLayout</a>.<br /><br />GridBagLayout is too verbose, and still feels too clumsy. This is why a while back I wrote <a href="http://easygridbag.sourceforge.net">a small tool</a> to help visualize various GridBagLayouts for people who are not used to it. But it would have been much simpler to use a better layout instead.<br /><br />MiGLayout is good, I managed to have good results without almost any practices on not so simple layouts. It also makes the code more concise.<br /><br />Related to my <a href="http://chasethedevil.blogspot.com/2008/04/swixml-review.html">previous post about SwiXml</a>, and as SwiXml does not yet support MiGLayout, I was thinking how easy it would be to achieve something relatively similar. With proper code conventions it is quite easy to describe the GUI outside a Java file, for example, for an easy start in a Beanshell file.<br /><br />The beanshell file would contain components construction, and MiGLayout of them afterwards, that&rsquo;s it. All listeners and component behaviours would be kept in java classes. With this kind of code split. The beanshell file is then extremely simple, as simple as the SwiXml.<br /><br />MiGLayout also has plenty of extra functionalities like &ldquo;<span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family: courier new;">hidemode 1</span></span>&rdquo; that can help automatically redoing the layout if a component becomes visible/invisible.</p>

I have had so many issues with &ldquo;partial&rdquo; upgrades in the past (with any distro).<br /><br />Although it is the preview/RC1 version, Fedora 9 is already as stable as a release IMHO. No issues so far, it feels more polished than Fedora 8. OpenJDK 1.6 is there. Firefox 3 is there.

      <p>Externalizing the screen layout is a natural step for many applications. It can be because a customer might want a slightly different presentation, or just for the sake of clearly separating layout code, or for using a kind of screen generator. Back in 2003, I wrote <a href="http://easygridbag.sourceforge.net">a small utility to help with GridBagLayout</a>, nothing fantastic,  but there was the feature of saving a generated layout in XML (or Beanshell) and using it in an application.<br /><br /><a href="http://swixml.org">SwiXml</a> saves a bit more than a layout as it instantiates the components as well, allowing to represent a hierarchy of components in XML. But it does not more than that. The &ldquo;no generation&rdquo; approach is interesting, I bet the author thinks the XML should be kept concise enough to be used easily without using a kind of generator. the XML is almost a mirror of Java code, but fortunately makes layouts more compact and easier to read. I tried version 1.51, and while it is quite well done, its documentation is a bit lacking and to me an important functionality is missing:<br /><br />There is no &ldquo;component&rdquo; tag by default. One needs to explicitely name the class of component we want to add. I think there could be a component tag that instantiate an 0 parameter constructor by default, using reflection for example. The class of component to instantiate would be found through the field name.<br /><br />Fortunately SwiXml is quite well done and this is not that big of an issue since you can just interpret new tags with 1 line of code:<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;"  ><blockquote></blockquote>engine.getTaglib().registerTag(&ldquo;datecombobox&rdquo;, DateComboBox.class);</span><br />for a Jide DateComboBox.<br /><br />I said documentation was lacking, because in my first non Hello World trial, I wanted to use the standard constant names for GridBagConstraints (RELATIVE,REMAINDER, FIRST_LINE, LAST_LINE, &hellip;). Putting <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;"  >&lt;gridbagconstraint anchor=&ldquo;FIRST_LINE&rdquo;&gt;</span>did not work. By reading the code, I found out you could achieve it but you have to do <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;"  >&lt;gridbagconstraint anchor=&ldquo;GridBagConstraint.FIRST_LINE&rdquo;&gt;</span>.<br /><br />In the end SwiXml left me with a good impression. It is non intrusive, and handle well enough what it is done for. One major drawback, you can only use either BorderLayout or GridBagLayout or FormLayout (from JGoodies).</p>
