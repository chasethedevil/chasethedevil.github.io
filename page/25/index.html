  </h1>
  <time datetime="2011-02-05T13:18:00Z" class="post-date">Sat, Feb 5, 2011</time>
  <p>Since 2007, there is a new kind of Mersenne-Twister (MT) that exploits SIMD architecture, the <a href="http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/%7Em-mat/MT/SFMT/">SFMT</a>. The Mersenne-Twister has set quite a standard in random number generation for Monte-Carlo simulations, even though it has flaws.</p>
<p>I was wondering if SFMT improved the performance over MT for a Java implementation. There is actually on the same page a decent Java port of the original algorithm. When I ran it, it ended up slower by more than 20% than the classical Mersenne-Twister (32-bit) on a 64-bit JDK 1.6.0.23 for Windows.</p>
<p>This kind of result is not too unsurprising as the code is more complex. But this shows that Java is unable to use SIMD instructions properly, which is still a bit disappointing.</p>

<div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Nvidia uses XorWow random number generator in its CURAND library. It is a simple and fast random number generator with a reasonably long period. It can also be parallelized relatively easily. Nvidia suggests it passes L'Ecuyer TestU01, but is not very explicit about it. So I've decided to see how it performed on TestU01.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I found very simple to test a new random number generator on TestU01, the documentation is great and the examples helpful. Basically there is just a simple C file to create &amp; compile &amp; run.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">XORWOW passes the SmallCrush battery, and according to Marsaglia, it also passes DieHard. But it fails on 1 test in Crush and 3 in BigCrush. By comparison, Mersenne-Twister fails on 2 tests in Crush and 2 in BigCrush. Here are the results of the failures:</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">========= Summary results of Crush =========<br /><br />&nbsp;Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TestU01 1.2.3<br />&nbsp;Generator:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xorwow<br />&nbsp;Number of statistics:&nbsp; 144<br />&nbsp;Total CPU time:&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:50:15.92<br />&nbsp;The following tests gave p-values outside [0.001, 0.9990]:<br />&nbsp;(eps&nbsp; means a value &lt; 1.0e-300):<br />&nbsp;(eps1 means a value &lt; 1.0e-15):<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p-value<br />&nbsp;----------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;72&nbsp; LinearComp, r = 29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - eps1<br />&nbsp;----------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;All other tests were passed</div><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">========= Summary results of BigCrush =========</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TestU01 1.2.3</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;Generator:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xorwow</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;Number of statistics:&nbsp; 160</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;Total CPU time:&nbsp;&nbsp; 06:12:38.79</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;The following tests gave p-values outside [0.001, 0.9990]:</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;(eps&nbsp; means a value &lt; 1.0e-300):</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;(eps1 means a value &lt; 1.0e-15):</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p-value</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;----------------------------------------------</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp; 7&nbsp; CollisionOver, t = 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.6e-6</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;27&nbsp; SimpPoker, r = 27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eps&nbsp; </span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;81&nbsp; LinearComp, r = 29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - eps1</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;----------------------------------------------</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;All other tests were passed</span>

  </h1>
  <time datetime="2011-01-03T16:07:00Z" class="post-date">Mon, Jan 3, 2011</time>
  <p>There is an <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0901/0901.0638v4.pdf">interesting</a> article on how to generate efficiently the inverse of the normal cumulative distribution on the GPU. This is useful for Monte-Carlo simulations based on normally distributed variables.</p>
<p>Another result of the paper is a method (breakless algorithm) to compute it apparently faster than the very good <a href="http://www.mth.kcl.ac.uk/~shaww/web_page/papers/Wichura.pdf">Wichura&rsquo;s AS241</a> algorithm on the CPU as well keeping a similar precision. The key is to avoid branches (if-then) at the cost of not avoiding log() calls. As the algorithm is very simple, I decided to give it a try in Java.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I found out that in Java, on 64 bit machines, the breakless algorithm is actually around twice slower. Intrigued, I tried in Visual C++ the same, and found this time it was 1.5x slower. Then I tried in gcc and found that it was 10% faster&hellip; But the total time was significant, because I had not applied any optimization in the gcc compilation. With -O3 flag AS241 became much faster and we were back at the Java result: the breakless algorithm was twice slower. The first result is that the JITed java code is as fast as optimized C++ compiled code. The second result is that the authors did not think of compiling with optimization flag.</p>
<p>Then I decided to benchmark the CUDA float performance of similar algorithms. The CUDA program was 7x faster than the double precision multithreaded CPU program. This is comparing Nvidia GT330m vs Core i5 520m and float precision vs double precision on a naturally parallel problem. This is very far from the usually announced x80 speedup. Of course if one compares the algorithms with GCC single threaded no optimization, we might attain x50, but this is not a realistic comparison at all. I have heard that double precision is 8x slower on the GPU when compared to float precision: the difference then becomes quite small. Apparently Fermi cards are much faster, unfortunately I don&rsquo;t have any. And still I would not expect much better than 10x speedup. This is good but very far from the usually advertised speedup.</p>

  <p>I temporarily <a href="/posts/bye-bye-firefox">abandonned Firefox</a> for Chrome/Chromium. I am now back at using Firefox as Firefox 4 is as fast or faster than Chrome and seems more stable, especially under linux. Also it does not send anything to Google and there is bookmark sync independently of Google.</p>

  </h1>
  <time datetime="2010-11-29T12:45:00Z" class="post-date">Mon, Nov 29, 2010</time>
  <p>A while ago, <a href="/post/the-pain-of-java-matrix-libraries">I was already looking</a> for a good Java Matrix library, complaining that there does not seem any real good one where development is still active: the 2 best ones are in my opinion <a href="http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/">Jama</a> and <a href="http://dsd.lbl.gov/~hoschek/colt/">Colt</a>.</p>
<p>Recently I tried to <a href="http://www.wilmott.com/detail.cfm?articleID=345">price options via RBF</a> (radial basis functions) based on <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1648878">TR-BDF2</a> time stepping.
This is a problem where one needs to do a few matrix multiplications and inverses (or better, LU solve) in a loop. The size of the matrix is typically 50x50 to 100x100, and one can loop between 10 and 1000 times.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity I decided to give <a href="http://ojalgo.org/">ojalgo</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/matrix-toolkits-java">MTJ</a> a chance. I had read benchmarks (<a href="http://blog.mikiobraun.de/2009/04/some-benchmark-numbers-for-jblas.html">here about jblas</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/java-matrix-benchmark/wiki/Runtime_2xXeon_2010_08">here the java matrix benchmark</a>) where those libraries performed really well.</p>
<p>On my core i5 laptop under the latest 64bit JVM (Windows 7), I found out that for the 100x100 case, <strong>Jama was actually 30% faster than MTJ</strong>, and ojalgo was more than 50% slower. I also found out that I did not like ojalgo API at all. I was quite disappointed by those results.</p>
<p>So I tried the same test on a 6-core Phenom II (ubuntu 64bit), Jama was faster than MTJ by 0-10%. Ojalgo and ParallelColt were slower than Jama by more than 50% and 30%.</p>
<p>This does not mean that ojalgo and ParallelColt are so bad, maybe they behave much better than the simple Jama on large matrices. They also have more features, including sparse matrices. But Jama is quite a good choice for a default library, MTJ can also be a good choice, it can be faster and use less memory because most methods take the output matrix/vector as a parameter. Furthermore MTJ can use the native lapack and blas libraries for improved performance. The bigger the matrices, the most difference it will make.</p>
 

<table border=1><tbody><tr><td>Run</td><td>Jama</td><td>MTJ</td><td>MTJ native</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.160</td><td>0.240</td><td>0.140</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0.086</td><td>0.200</td><td>0.220</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>0.083</td><td>0.089</td><td>0.056</td></tr></tbody></table>

  <time datetime="2010-08-12T17:32:00Z" class="post-date">Thu, Aug 12, 2010</time>
   

Before Java 1.5, I never really complained about the lack of <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: purple;">enum</span></span></b> keyword. Sure the <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/Books/shiftintojava/page1.html">old enum via class pattern</a> was a bit verbose at first (N.B.: Java 1.5 enums can also be verbose once you start adding methods to them). But more importantly, you would often use the table lookup pattern in combination.<br /><br />The problem with Java 1.5 <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: purple;">enum</span></span></b> is that it is not Object-Oriented. You <u>can't extend</u> an <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: purple;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">enum</span></span></b>, you can't add an element in an existing enum. Many will say "but that's what enum is for, a static list of things". In my experience, &nbsp;the list of things often changes with time, or needs to be extended at one point. Furthermore, most people (including me when I am very lazy) end up writing switch statements on enum values. Enum promotes bad programming practices.<br /><br />Think twice about using enum, this is often not what you want.

  </h1>
  <time datetime="2010-08-07T12:35:00Z" class="post-date">Sat, Aug 7, 2010</time>
   

I tried Scala <a href="http://chasethedevil.blogspot.com/2007/09/fast-web-development-with-scala.html">a few years ago</a>. There are several good ideas in it, but I found the language to be a bit too complicated to master. But I recently stubbled upon <a href="http://lamp.epfl.ch/~dragos/files/scala-spec.pdf">a paper on Scala generics</a>&nbsp;that might change my mind about using Scala.<br /><br />Scala Generics used to work in a similar way as Java Generics: via type erasure. One main reason is compatibility with Java, another is that C++ like templates make the code base blow up. Scala Generics offered some additional behavior (the variance/covariance notion).&nbsp;C++ templates, however, have some very interesting aspects: one is that everything is done at compile time, the other is &nbsp;performance. If the generics are involved in any kind of computation intensive task, all the Java type conversion will create a significant overhead.<br /><br />Now Scala has <b><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/specialized.html">@specialized</a></b>&nbsp;(since Scala 2.8). Annotating a generic type with @specialized will generate code. One has the choice to accept the performance penalty or to get all the performance but accept the code blow up. I think this is very useful.<br /><br />If you read the paper you will see that the performance implications of this are not always small.<br /><br />UPDATE: I thank the readers for pointing that this work only with primitive types to avoid autoboxing. It is still valuable but less than I first thought.

  <p>I have been a long user of Firefox, mostly thanks to the adblock extension. But recently, Firefox decided to change the way arrows work on the web pages, they don&rsquo;t make the page scroll anymore. Meanwhile Chrome has now a good adblock plugin (that filters ads on load, not after load like it use to be) and is really much much faster than Firefox. So there is no more reason not to use it.</p>
<p>Hello Chrome, bye bye Firefox. Google has won the web browsers war.</p>

Yes, I wrote an applet. I know it is very 1990s but, amazingly, it still does the job quite well. Ok, next time I should really use Flash to do this.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9RyqGT46Fbk/TA-C4-xEq8I/AAAAAAAAFH8/OwEFEpO4eA8/s1600/dla.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9RyqGT46Fbk/TA-C4-xEq8I/AAAAAAAAFH8/OwEFEpO4eA8/s320/dla.png" /></a></div><br />The Applet simulates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation">Diffusion Limited Aggregation</a> as described in Chaos And Fractals from Peitgen, Juergens, and Saupe. It represents ions randomly wandering around (in a Brownian motion) until they are caught by an attractive force in electrochemical deposition experiment. This kind of phenomenon occurs at all scales, for example it happens in the distribution of galaxies. You can play around with the applet at <a href="http://31416.appspot.com/dla.vm">http://31416.appspot.com/dla.vm</a>
