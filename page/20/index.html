  <p>Many people are not enthusiastic of this phone sound if you read silly forums. They are wrong! the sound coming out of this thin phone is amazing, at least with high quality headphones. I find the akg q601 incredible with it: much much better than with the old ipod nano or the cowon i7.</p>
<p>In general most complaints i have read about the phone were wrong. The battery is ok, the size is great.</p>

  </h1>
  <time datetime="2012-02-06T17:52:00Z" class="post-date">Mon, Feb 6, 2012</time>
   

I am trying <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> again. Last time, several years ago, I played around with it as a web tool, combining it with a Servlet Runner like Tomcat. This time, I play around with it for some quantitative finance experiments.<br /><br /><b>Why Scala?</b> It still seem the most advanced alternative to Java on the JVM, and the mix of functional programming and OO programming is interesting. Furthermore it goes quite far as it ships with its own library. I was curious to see if I could express some things better with Scala.<br /><br />Here are my first impressions after a week:<br /><ul><li>I like the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">object</span> keyword. It avoids the messy singleton pattern, or the classes with many static methods. I think it makes things much cleaner to not use static at all but distinguish between <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">object</span> &amp; <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">class</span>.</li><li>I like the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Array[Double]</span>, and especially <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">ArrayBuffer[Double]</span>. Finally we don't have to worry between the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Double</span> and <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">double</span> performance issues.</li><li>I was a bit annoyed by <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">a(i)</span> instead of <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">a[i]</span> but it makes sense. I wonder if there is a performance implication for arrays, hopefully not.</li><li>I like the real properties, automatic getter/setter: less boilerplate code, less getThis(), setThat(toto).</li><li>Very natural interaction with Java libraries. </li><li>I found a good use of <b>case classes</b> (to my surprise): typically an enum that can have some well defined parameters, and that you don't want to make a class (because it's not). My use case was to define boundaries of a spline.</li><li>I love the formatter in the scala (eclipse) IDE. Finally a formatter in eclipse that does not produce crap.</li></ul>Now things I still need time to get used to:<br /><ul><li> member variable declared implicitly in the constructor. I first made the mistake (still?) to declare some variables twice.</li><li>I got hit by starting a line with a <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">+</span> instead of ending with a <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">+</span>. It is dangerous, but it certainly makes the code more consistent.</li><li>Performance impacts: I will need to take a look at the bytecode for some scala constructs to really understand the performance impact of some uses. For example I tend to use while loops instead of for comprehension after some scary post of the Twitter guys about for comprehension. But at first, it looks as fast as Java.</li><li>I wrote my code a bit fast. I am sure I could make use of more Scala features.</li><li>The scala IDE in eclipse 3.7.1 has known issues. I wish it was a bit more functional, but it's quite ok (search for references works, renaming works to some extent).</li><li>Scala unit tests: I used scala tests, but it seems a bit funny at first. Also I am not convinced by the syntax that avoid method names and prefer test("test name"). It makes it more difficult to browse the source code.</li></ul>Some things they should consider:<br /><ul><li>Integrate directly a Log API. I just use SLF4J without any scala wrapper, but it feels like it should be part of the standard API (even if that did not work out so well for Sun).</li><li>Double.Epsilon is not the machine epsilon: very strange. I found out somewhere else there was the machine epsilon, don't remember where because I ended up just making a small <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">object</span>.</li><li>Unit tests should be part of the standard API.</li></ul>Overall I found it quite exciting as there are definitely new ways to solve problems. It was a while since I had been excited with actual coding.

  <time datetime="2012-01-27T13:38:00Z" class="post-date">Fri, Jan 27, 2012</time>
   

KDE 4.8 finally has a dock: you just have to add the plasma icon tasks. Also the flexibility around ALT+TAB is welcome. With Krusader as file manager, Thunderbird and Firefox for email and web, it is becoming a real nice desktop, but it took a while since the very bad KDE 4.0 release.<br /><br />It is easy to install under ubuntu 11.10 through the backports and seems very stable so far.<br /><br />Something quite important is to tweak the fonts: use Déjà Vu Sans instead of Ubuntu fonts, use RGB subpixel rendering, use Crisp desktop effects. With those settings, KDE looks very nice. It's sad that they are not default in Kubuntu.<br /><br /><b>Update March 2013</b>:<i> It's been a while now that it is in the standard Ubuntu repositories and I believe installed by default, one has just to remove the task manager widget add the icon task widget:</i><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_LWYVO4CCKQ/UUry_yhXmQI/AAAAAAAAGSw/JPGByZuWsdw/s1600/snapshot3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="60" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_LWYVO4CCKQ/UUry_yhXmQI/AAAAAAAAGSw/JPGByZuWsdw/s400/snapshot3.png" width="400" /></a></div><i>One can also change the settings using a right click (I find useful not to highlight the windows) and it can look like:</i><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VqpLb8rULAQ/UUrz8cPYleI/AAAAAAAAGTA/fs3b8ytQID8/s1600/snapshot4.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="60" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VqpLb8rULAQ/UUrz8cPYleI/AAAAAAAAGTA/fs3b8ytQID8/s400/snapshot4.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />

  <p>I have never really thought very much about generating random numbers according to a precise discrete distribution, for example to simulate an unfair dice. In finance, we are generally interested in continuous distributions, where there is typically 2 ways: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling">inverse transform</a> (usually computed in a numerical way), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling">acceptance-rejection</a> method (typically the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggurat_algorithm">ziggurat</a>. The inverse transform is often preferred, because it&rsquo;s usable method for Quasi Monte-Carlo simulations while the acceptance rejection is not.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would have thought about the simple way to generate random numbers according to a discrete distribution as first described <a href="http://www.delicious.com/redirect?url=http%3A//blog.sigfpe.com/2012/01/lossless-decompression-and-generation.html">here</a>. But establishing a link with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman encoding</a> is brilliant. Some better performing alternative (unrelated to Huffman) is offered <a href="http://www.keithschwarz.com/darts-dice-coins/">there</a>.</p>

  <time datetime="2011-12-21T17:37:00Z" class="post-date">Wed, Dec 21, 2011</time>
   

Recently, I interviewed someone for a quant position. I was very surprised to find out that someone who did one of the best master in probabilities and finance in France could not solve a very basic probability problem:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-64ejCSg9Y8o/TvIHEF4PgwI/AAAAAAAAFio/uxVwdwVnQ54/s1600/Screenshot+at+2011-12-21+17%253A18%253A28.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="43" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-64ejCSg9Y8o/TvIHEF4PgwI/AAAAAAAAFio/uxVwdwVnQ54/s400/Screenshot+at+2011-12-21+17%253A18%253A28.png" width="400" /></a></div>This is accessible to someone with very little knowledge of probabilities <br /><br />When I asked this problem around to co-workers (who have all at least a master in a scientific subject), very few could actually answer it properly. Most of the time, I suspect it is because they did not dedicate enough time to do it properly, and wanted to answer it too quickly.<br /><br />It was more shocking that someone just out of school, with a major in probabilities could not answer that properly. It raises the question: what is all this education worth?<br /><br />The results were not better as soon as the question was not exactly like what students in those masters are used to, like for example, this simple stochastic calculus question:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K9mO8qrp1Ow/TvIKO_MTOSI/AAAAAAAAFiw/igPGRdnFNEo/s1600/Screenshot+at+2011-12-21+17%253A19%253A11.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K9mO8qrp1Ow/TvIKO_MTOSI/AAAAAAAAFiw/igPGRdnFNEo/s1600/Screenshot+at+2011-12-21+17%253A19%253A11.png" /></a></div><br /><br />My opinion is that, today in our society, people study for too long. The ideal system for me would be one where people learn a lot in math/physics the first 2 years of university, and then have more freedom in their education, much like a doctorate.<br /><br />We still offered the job to this person, because live problem solving is not the most important criteria. Other qualities like seriousness and motivation are much more valuable.

  <time datetime="2011-11-30T18:11:00Z" class="post-date">Wed, Nov 30, 2011</time>
  <p>In a previous post, I was complaining how <a href="/posts/gnome-3-unity-crap">bad Gnome 3</a> was. Since I have installed a real dock: docky, it is now much more usable. I can easily switch / launch applications without an annoying full screen change.</p>
<p>In addition I found out that it had a good desktop search (tracker). The ALT+F2 also does some sort of completion, too bad it can not use tracker here as well.</p>
<p>So it looks like Gnome 3 + gnome-tweak-tool + docky makes a reasonably good desktop. XFCE does not really fit the bill for me: bad handling of sound, bad default applications, not so good integration with gnome application notifications.

I recently tried to minimise a function according to some constraints. One popular method to minimise a function in several dimensions is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNelder%25E2%2580%2593Mead_method&amp;ei=PfHETsKYDdG9sAb_q935Cw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVD7lMV4buMbVCJ3fuiyupPA6B1w">Nelder-Mead Simplex</a>. It is quite simple, so simple that I programmed it in Java in 1h30, including a small design and a test. It helped that the original paper from Nelder-Mead is very clear:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-glZ52IB0SkA/TsTxF4VmyFI/AAAAAAAAFhw/zSDQ0Het9MU/s1600/neldermeadalgo.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="184" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-glZ52IB0SkA/TsTxF4VmyFI/AAAAAAAAFhw/zSDQ0Het9MU/s320/neldermeadalgo.png" width="320" /></a></div>However the main issue is that it works only for unconstrained problems. Nelder and Mead suggested to add a penalty, but in practice this does not work so well. For constrained problems, there is an adaptation of the original idea by Box (incredible name for a constrained method) that he called <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcomjnl.oxfordjournals.org%2Fcontent%2F8%2F1%2F42.full.pdf&amp;ei=EvLETqz6LcTvsgbN4I2ADA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHq6JD1ik4rTLO4a1v4G9adbGMRzQ">the Complex method</a>, a deliberate pun to the Nelder-Mead Simplex method. The basic idea is to reset the trial point near the fixed boundary if it goes outside. Now this took me much longer to program, as the paper is not as clear, even if the method is still relatively simple. But worst, after a day of deciphering the paper and programming the complex method, I find out that it does not works so well: it does not manage to minimise a simple multidimensional quadratic with a simple bound constraint: f(X)=sum(X)^2 with X &gt;= 0 where X is an N-dimensional vector. In the end, I don't want to work with such a simple function, but it is a good simple test to see if the method is really working or not. Here is how the function looks with N=2:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ncMKzKcYdtA/TsT_TEyNHDI/AAAAAAAAFiA/er1pQWNcHXc/s1600/quadfull.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ncMKzKcYdtA/TsT_TEyNHDI/AAAAAAAAFiA/er1pQWNcHXc/s320/quadfull.png" width="302" /></a></div>And if we restrict to x,y &gt;= 0 it becomes:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-msyZ9eQ7GnM/TsT_d36SD7I/AAAAAAAAFiI/Kt4QBwjsAE8/s1600/quadpart.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="304" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-msyZ9eQ7GnM/TsT_d36SD7I/AAAAAAAAFiI/Kt4QBwjsAE8/s320/quadpart.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />I suspected an error in my program, so I decided to try with scilab, that has also the Box method as part of their <a href="http://help.scilab.org/docs/5.3.3/en_US/neldermead.html">neldermead_search</a> functionality. Scilab also failed to compute the minimum in 8 dimensions of my simple quadratic. <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vO6JhSwv3MU/TsT1ge1H96I/AAAAAAAAFh4/DTnsYjnMeHE/s1600/neldermeadalgo1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vO6JhSwv3MU/TsT1ge1H96I/AAAAAAAAFh4/DTnsYjnMeHE/s320/neldermeadalgo1.png" width="265" /></a></div>I tried various settings, without ever obtaining a decent result (I expect to find a value near 0).<br /><br />There is another algorithm that can find a global minimum, also very popular: the <a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/%7Estorn/TR-95-012.pdf">Differential Evolution</a>. At first, being a genetic algorithm, you would think it would be complicated to write. But no, the main loop is around 20 lines.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cNeeYo8EQeQ/TsUB7Ek6rQI/AAAAAAAAFiQ/PTc4qwwAa7E/s1600/dealgo.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cNeeYo8EQeQ/TsUB7Ek6rQI/AAAAAAAAFiQ/PTc4qwwAa7E/s320/dealgo.png" width="297" /></a></div><br />Those 20 lines are a bit more difficult than Nelder-Mead, but still, when I saw that, I understood that "this is a classic algorithm". And it does work with constraints easily. How to do this is explained well in K. Price book "Differential Evolution", and takes only a few lines of code. Here is the result I got in dimension 29:<br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: x-small;">dim=29 min=1.2601854176573729E-12 genMax=412 x=[3.340096901536317E-8, 8.889252404343621E-8, 7.163904251807348E-10, 9.71847877381699E-9, 2.7423324674150668E-8, 2.4022269439114537E-9, 1.7336434478718816E-11, 7.244238163901778E-9, 1.0013136274729337E-8, 7.412154679865083E-9, 5.4694460144807974E-9, 2.3682413086417524E-9, 4.241739250073559E-7, 4.821920889534676E-10, 2.115396281722523E-9, 8.750883007882899E-8, 2.512011485133975E-9, 4.811507109129279E-9, 1.0752997894113096E-7, 5.120475258343548E-9, 8.404448964497456E-9, 4.1062290228305595E-9, 1.7030766521603753E-8, 5.589430643552073E-9, 8.237098544820173E-10, 3.5796523161196554E-9, 5.186299547466997E-9, 2.430326342762937E-7, 5.493850433494286E-9]</span><br /><br />It works well, although there is quite a bit of parameters. I noticed that the strategy was especially important.
