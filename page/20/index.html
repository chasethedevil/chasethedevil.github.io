KDE 4.8 finally has a dock: you just have to add the plasma icon tasks. Also the flexibility around ALT+TAB is welcome. With Krusader as file manager, Thunderbird and Firefox for email and web, it is becoming a real nice desktop, but it took a while since the very bad KDE 4.0 release.<br /><br />It is easy to install under ubuntu 11.10 through the backports and seems very stable so far.<br /><br />Something quite important is to tweak the fonts: use Déjà Vu Sans instead of Ubuntu fonts, use RGB subpixel rendering, use Crisp desktop effects. With those settings, KDE looks very nice. It's sad that they are not default in Kubuntu.<br /><br /><b>Update March 2013</b>:<i> It's been a while now that it is in the standard Ubuntu repositories and I believe installed by default, one has just to remove the task manager widget add the icon task widget:</i><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_LWYVO4CCKQ/UUry_yhXmQI/AAAAAAAAGSw/JPGByZuWsdw/s1600/snapshot3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="60" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_LWYVO4CCKQ/UUry_yhXmQI/AAAAAAAAGSw/JPGByZuWsdw/s400/snapshot3.png" width="400" /></a></div><i>One can also change the settings using a right click (I find useful not to highlight the windows) and it can look like:</i><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VqpLb8rULAQ/UUrz8cPYleI/AAAAAAAAGTA/fs3b8ytQID8/s1600/snapshot4.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="60" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VqpLb8rULAQ/UUrz8cPYleI/AAAAAAAAGTA/fs3b8ytQID8/s400/snapshot4.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />

I have never really thought very much about generating random numbers according to a precise discrete distribution, for example to simulate an unfair dice. In finance, we are generally interested in continuous distributions, where there is typically 2 ways: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling">inverse transform</a> (usually computed in a numerical way), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling">acceptance-rejection</a> method (typically the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggurat_algorithm">ziggurat</a>). The inverse transform is often preferred, because it's usable method for Quasi Monte-Carlo simulations while the acceptance rejection is not.<br /><br />I would have thought about the simple way to generate random numbers according to a discrete distribution as first described <a href="http://www.delicious.com/redirect?url=http%3A//blog.sigfpe.com/2012/01/lossless-decompression-and-generation.html">here</a>. But establishing a link with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman encoding</a> is brilliant. Some better performing alternative (unrelated to Huffman) is offered <a href="http://www.keithschwarz.com/darts-dice-coins/">there</a>.

Recently, I interviewed someone for a quant position. I was very surprised to find out that someone who did one of the best master in probabilities and finance in France could not solve a very basic probability problem:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-64ejCSg9Y8o/TvIHEF4PgwI/AAAAAAAAFio/uxVwdwVnQ54/s1600/Screenshot+at+2011-12-21+17%253A18%253A28.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="43" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-64ejCSg9Y8o/TvIHEF4PgwI/AAAAAAAAFio/uxVwdwVnQ54/s400/Screenshot+at+2011-12-21+17%253A18%253A28.png" width="400" /></a></div>This is accessible to someone with very little knowledge of probabilities <br /><br />When I asked this problem around to co-workers (who have all at least a master in a scientific subject), very few could actually answer it properly. Most of the time, I suspect it is because they did not dedicate enough time to do it properly, and wanted to answer it too quickly.<br /><br />It was more shocking that someone just out of school, with a major in probabilities could not answer that properly. It raises the question: what is all this education worth?<br /><br />The results were not better as soon as the question was not exactly like what students in those masters are used to, like for example, this simple stochastic calculus question:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K9mO8qrp1Ow/TvIKO_MTOSI/AAAAAAAAFiw/igPGRdnFNEo/s1600/Screenshot+at+2011-12-21+17%253A19%253A11.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K9mO8qrp1Ow/TvIKO_MTOSI/AAAAAAAAFiw/igPGRdnFNEo/s1600/Screenshot+at+2011-12-21+17%253A19%253A11.png" /></a></div><br /><br />My opinion is that, today in our society, people study for too long. The ideal system for me would be one where people learn a lot in math/physics the first 2 years of university, and then have more freedom in their education, much like a doctorate.<br /><br />We still offered the job to this person, because live problem solving is not the most important criteria. Other qualities like seriousness and motivation are much more valuable.

In a previous post, I was complaining how <a href="http://chasethedevil.blogspot.com/2011/08/gnome-3-unity-crap.html">bad Gnome 3</a> was. Since I have installed a real dock: docky, it is now much more usable. I can easily switch / launch applications without an annoying full screen change.<br /><br />In addition I found out that it had a good desktop search (tracker). The ALT+F2 also does some sort of completion, too bad it can not use tracker here as well.<br /><br />So it looks like Gnome 3 + gnome-tweak-tool + docky makes a reasonably good desktop. XFCE does not really fit the bill for me: bad handling of sound, bad default applications, not so good integration with gnome application notifications.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2DF1jycI5ZU/TtZmvdt2k-I/AAAAAAAAFic/ej8a7g1Gswg/s1600/Screenshot+at+2011-11-30+18%253A20%253A29.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2DF1jycI5ZU/TtZmvdt2k-I/AAAAAAAAFic/ej8a7g1Gswg/s320/Screenshot+at+2011-11-30+18%253A20%253A29.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Now if only I found a way to change this ugly big white scrollbar...

I recently tried to minimise a function according to some constraints. One popular method to minimise a function in several dimensions is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNelder%25E2%2580%2593Mead_method&amp;ei=PfHETsKYDdG9sAb_q935Cw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVD7lMV4buMbVCJ3fuiyupPA6B1w">Nelder-Mead Simplex</a>. It is quite simple, so simple that I programmed it in Java in 1h30, including a small design and a test. It helped that the original paper from Nelder-Mead is very clear:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-glZ52IB0SkA/TsTxF4VmyFI/AAAAAAAAFhw/zSDQ0Het9MU/s1600/neldermeadalgo.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="184" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-glZ52IB0SkA/TsTxF4VmyFI/AAAAAAAAFhw/zSDQ0Het9MU/s320/neldermeadalgo.png" width="320" /></a></div>However the main issue is that it works only for unconstrained problems. Nelder and Mead suggested to add a penalty, but in practice this does not work so well. For constrained problems, there is an adaptation of the original idea by Box (incredible name for a constrained method) that he called <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcomjnl.oxfordjournals.org%2Fcontent%2F8%2F1%2F42.full.pdf&amp;ei=EvLETqz6LcTvsgbN4I2ADA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHq6JD1ik4rTLO4a1v4G9adbGMRzQ">the Complex method</a>, a deliberate pun to the Nelder-Mead Simplex method. The basic idea is to reset the trial point near the fixed boundary if it goes outside. Now this took me much longer to program, as the paper is not as clear, even if the method is still relatively simple. But worst, after a day of deciphering the paper and programming the complex method, I find out that it does not works so well: it does not manage to minimise a simple multidimensional quadratic with a simple bound constraint: f(X)=sum(X)^2 with X &gt;= 0 where X is an N-dimensional vector. In the end, I don't want to work with such a simple function, but it is a good simple test to see if the method is really working or not. Here is how the function looks with N=2:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ncMKzKcYdtA/TsT_TEyNHDI/AAAAAAAAFiA/er1pQWNcHXc/s1600/quadfull.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ncMKzKcYdtA/TsT_TEyNHDI/AAAAAAAAFiA/er1pQWNcHXc/s320/quadfull.png" width="302" /></a></div>And if we restrict to x,y &gt;= 0 it becomes:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-msyZ9eQ7GnM/TsT_d36SD7I/AAAAAAAAFiI/Kt4QBwjsAE8/s1600/quadpart.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="304" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-msyZ9eQ7GnM/TsT_d36SD7I/AAAAAAAAFiI/Kt4QBwjsAE8/s320/quadpart.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />I suspected an error in my program, so I decided to try with scilab, that has also the Box method as part of their <a href="http://help.scilab.org/docs/5.3.3/en_US/neldermead.html">neldermead_search</a> functionality. Scilab also failed to compute the minimum in 8 dimensions of my simple quadratic. <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vO6JhSwv3MU/TsT1ge1H96I/AAAAAAAAFh4/DTnsYjnMeHE/s1600/neldermeadalgo1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vO6JhSwv3MU/TsT1ge1H96I/AAAAAAAAFh4/DTnsYjnMeHE/s320/neldermeadalgo1.png" width="265" /></a></div>I tried various settings, without ever obtaining a decent result (I expect to find a value near 0).<br /><br />There is another algorithm that can find a global minimum, also very popular: the <a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/%7Estorn/TR-95-012.pdf">Differential Evolution</a>. At first, being a genetic algorithm, you would think it would be complicated to write. But no, the main loop is around 20 lines.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cNeeYo8EQeQ/TsUB7Ek6rQI/AAAAAAAAFiQ/PTc4qwwAa7E/s1600/dealgo.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cNeeYo8EQeQ/TsUB7Ek6rQI/AAAAAAAAFiQ/PTc4qwwAa7E/s320/dealgo.png" width="297" /></a></div><br />Those 20 lines are a bit more difficult than Nelder-Mead, but still, when I saw that, I understood that "this is a classic algorithm". And it does work with constraints easily. How to do this is explained well in K. Price book "Differential Evolution", and takes only a few lines of code. Here is the result I got in dimension 29:<br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: x-small;">dim=29 min=1.2601854176573729E-12 genMax=412 x=[3.340096901536317E-8, 8.889252404343621E-8, 7.163904251807348E-10, 9.71847877381699E-9, 2.7423324674150668E-8, 2.4022269439114537E-9, 1.7336434478718816E-11, 7.244238163901778E-9, 1.0013136274729337E-8, 7.412154679865083E-9, 5.4694460144807974E-9, 2.3682413086417524E-9, 4.241739250073559E-7, 4.821920889534676E-10, 2.115396281722523E-9, 8.750883007882899E-8, 2.512011485133975E-9, 4.811507109129279E-9, 1.0752997894113096E-7, 5.120475258343548E-9, 8.404448964497456E-9, 4.1062290228305595E-9, 1.7030766521603753E-8, 5.589430643552073E-9, 8.237098544820173E-10, 3.5796523161196554E-9, 5.186299547466997E-9, 2.430326342762937E-7, 5.493850433494286E-9]</span><br /><br />It works well, although there is quite a bit of parameters. I noticed that the strategy was especially important.

After the upgrate to Ubuntu 11.04 I was directly on Unity. Having a dock on the left side is nice, but unfortunately, it has various bugs which makes it sometimes annoying. Also the menu on top like Mac Os X is not a bad idea, but it breaks many apps (for example Picasa). Then there is the scrollbar insanity, it's almost impossible to click on to scroll, and again breaks in some apps (for example Eclipse). Fortunately one can disable all of that and go back to the old Gnome 2.<br /><br />Then I decided to try Gnome 3 the past 2 weeks. I was curious that Linus found it so bad. At first it looked nice, probably because it's different. But very quickly, it becomes annoying: the full screen changed just to switch window with the mouse is a stupid idea. And then installing Gnome 3 in Ubuntu is not such a great idea: Rhythmbox does not work well anymore with it, all my "file open" mapping was gone and replaced with garbage: why does it propose GIMP to open a PDF is beyond me.<br /><br />Gnome 2 + a nice standard dock + widgets (or the nice unity indicators) + an indexer would have been perfect. Now I am back to KDE 4 which provides all of that, even if it feels a bit bloated.<br /><br /><br />

Finally someone who shares the same opinion on the current state of GPGPU programming. <br /><br />John Carmack: On the other hand, we have converted all of our offline processing stuff to ray tracing. For years, the back-end MegaTexture generation for Rage was done with... we had a GPGPU cluster with NVIDIA cards and it was such a huge pain to keep. It was an amazing pain where one system would be having heat problems and would be behaving weird even though we thought they had identical drivers. Something would always be wrong with render farm 12, and whenever we wanted to put in new features it was like “Okay, writing new fragment programs to go into this.” Now, granted I did this just when CUDA was in its infancy. If I did re-implement it with OpenCL or CUDA we wouldn’t have some of these problems, but when I converted all these over to ray tracing there was a number of things that got a lot better. Things that we deal with, [for example] shadows and reflections that have to be approximated, and were so used to doing with rasterization... we sometimes forget how big of hacks these are. To be able to say I really just want that ray, and tell me what it hit; not do a projection with feathering shadowed edges and whatever the heck else we’re doing there, so much of the code got so much easier. If it’s a choice of... now that we have these awesome multi-core x86 CPUs where we can get 24 threads in commodity boxes... it’s true that one GPU card can do more ray tracing than one 24 thread x86 box, but it’s not multiples more and if it’s just a matter of buying more $2000 boxes, it makes the development, maintenance, and upkeep much better. While everyone in high performance computing is all “rah-rah” GPUs right now, I’ve come full circle back around to saying the fact that we can get massive amounts of x86 cores and threads... it wont win on FLOPS/watt or FLOPS/volume, but in terms of results per developer hour it is much, much better.

Today I found out that replacing <b>Math.pow(x,y) </b>by <b>Math.exp(y*Math.log(x)) </b>made me gain 50% performance in my program. Of course, both x and y are double in my case. I find this quite surprising, I expected better from Math.pow.

I just miraculously received some AKG Q701 headphones. I never tried really high end headphones before those. I was used to my Sennheiser HD555, which I thought were quite good already.<br /><br />I always thought there was not much difference between let's say a $100 headphone and a $500 one, and that only real audiophiles would be able notice the difference: people like Jake who can distinguish artefacts in 320kbps mp3, but not people like me. I was wrong. Those headphones make a real difference, everything seems very clear, and it doesn't feel like listening music through headphones at all, it is much closer to a good hi-fi stereo sound on the ear.
