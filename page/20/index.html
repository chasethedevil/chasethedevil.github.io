  <p>I am trying <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scala<!-- raw HTML omitted --> again. Last time, several years ago, I played around with it as a web tool, combining it with a Servlet Runner like Tomcat. This time, I play around with it for some quantitative finance experiments.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why Scala?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It still seem the most advanced alternative to Java on the JVM, and the mix of functional programming and OO programming is interesting. Furthermore it goes quite far as it ships with its own library. I was curious to see if I could express some things better with Scala.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here are my first impressions after a week:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->object<!-- raw HTML omitted --> keyword. It avoids the messy singleton pattern, or the classes with many static methods. I think it makes things much cleaner to not use static at all but distinguish between <!-- raw HTML omitted -->object<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &amp; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->class<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Array[Double]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and especially <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ArrayBuffer[Double]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Finally we don&rsquo;t have to worry between the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Double<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->double<!-- raw HTML omitted --> performance issues.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was a bit annoyed by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a(i)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> instead of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a[i]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but it makes sense. I wonder if there is a performance implication for arrays, hopefully not.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like the real properties, automatic getter/setter: less boilerplate code, less getThis(), setThat(toto).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Very natural interaction with Java libraries. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I found a good use of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->case classes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (to my surprise): typically an enum that can have some well defined parameters, and that you don&rsquo;t want to make a class (because it&rsquo;s not). My use case was to define boundaries of a spline.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I love the formatter in the scala (eclipse) IDE. Finally a formatter in eclipse that does not produce crap.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now things I still need time to get used to:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> member variable declared implicitly in the constructor. I first made the mistake (still?) to declare some variables twice.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I got hit by starting a line with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->+<!-- raw HTML omitted --> instead of ending with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->+<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It is dangerous, but it certainly makes the code more consistent.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Performance impacts: I will need to take a look at the bytecode for some scala constructs to really understand the performance impact of some uses. For example I tend to use while loops instead of for comprehension after some scary post of the Twitter guys about for comprehension. But at first, it looks as fast as Java.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wrote my code a bit fast. I am sure I could make use of more Scala features.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The scala IDE in eclipse 3.7.1 has known issues. I wish it was a bit more functional, but it&rsquo;s quite ok (search for references works, renaming works to some extent).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scala unit tests: I used scala tests, but it seems a bit funny at first. Also I am not convinced by the syntax that avoid method names and prefer test(&ldquo;test name&rdquo;). It makes it more difficult to browse the source code.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some things they should consider:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Integrate directly a Log API. I just use SLF4J without any scala wrapper, but it feels like it should be part of the standard API (even if that did not work out so well for Sun).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Double.Epsilon is not the machine epsilon: very strange. I found out somewhere else there was the machine epsilon, don&rsquo;t remember where because I ended up just making a small <!-- raw HTML omitted -->object<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unit tests should be part of the standard API.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overall I found it quite exciting as there are definitely new ways to solve problems. It was a while since I had been excited with actual coding.</p>

  <p>KDE 4.8 finally has a dock: you just have to add the plasma icon tasks. Also the flexibility around ALT+TAB is welcome. With Krusader as file manager, Thunderbird and Firefox for email and web, it is becoming a real nice desktop, but it took a while since the very bad KDE 4.0 release.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is easy to install under ubuntu 11.10 through the backports and seems very stable so far.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Something quite important is to tweak the fonts: use Déjà Vu Sans instead of Ubuntu fonts, use RGB subpixel rendering, use Crisp desktop effects. With those settings, KDE looks very nice. It&rsquo;s sad that they are not default in Kubuntu.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update March 2013<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It&rsquo;s been a while now that it is in the standard Ubuntu repositories and I believe installed by default, one has just to remove the task manager widget add the icon task widget:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One can also change the settings using a right click (I find useful not to highlight the windows) and it can look like:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

  <p>I have never really thought very much about generating random numbers according to a precise discrete distribution, for example to simulate an unfair dice. In finance, we are generally interested in continuous distributions, where there is typically 2 ways: the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->inverse transform<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (usually computed in a numerical way), and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->acceptance-rejection<!-- raw HTML omitted --> method (typically the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ziggurat<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). The inverse transform is often preferred, because it&rsquo;s usable method for Quasi Monte-Carlo simulations while the acceptance rejection is not.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would have thought about the simple way to generate random numbers according to a discrete distribution as first described <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But establishing a link with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Huffman encoding<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is brilliant. Some better performing alternative (unrelated to Huffman) is offered <!-- raw HTML omitted -->there<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

  <p>Recently, I interviewed someone for a quant position. I was very surprised to find out that someone who did one of the best master in probabilities and finance in France could not solve a very basic probability problem:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is accessible to someone with very little knowledge of probabilities <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I asked this problem around to co-workers (who have all at least a master in a scientific subject), very few could actually answer it properly. Most of the time, I suspect it is because they did not dedicate enough time to do it properly, and wanted to answer it too quickly.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It was more shocking that someone just out of school, with a major in probabilities could not answer that properly. It raises the question: what is all this education worth?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The results were not better as soon as the question was not exactly like what students in those masters are used to, like for example, this simple stochastic calculus question:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My opinion is that, today in our society, people study for too long.

Other qualities like seriousness and motivation are much more valuable.</p>

  <p>In a previous post, I was complaining how <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bad Gnome 3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was. Since I have installed a real dock: docky, it is now much more usable.

The ALT+F2 also does some sort of completion, too bad it can not use tracker here as well.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So it looks like Gnome 3 + gnome-tweak-tool + docky makes a reasonably good desktop.

  <p>I recently tried to minimise a function according to some constraints. One popular method to minimise a function in several dimensions is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nelder-Mead Simplex<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It is quite simple, so simple that I programmed it in Java in 1h30, including a small design and a test. It helped that the original paper from Nelder-Mead is very clear:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->However the main issue is that it works only for unconstrained problems. Nelder and Mead suggested to add a penalty, but in practice this does not work so well. For constrained problems, there is an adaptation of the original idea by Box (incredible name for a constrained method) that he called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Complex method<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a deliberate pun to the Nelder-Mead Simplex method. The basic idea is to reset the trial point near the fixed boundary if it goes outside. Now this took me much longer to program, as the paper is not as clear, even if the method is still relatively simple. But worst, after a day of deciphering the paper and programming the complex method, I find out that it does not works so well: it does not manage to minimise a simple multidimensional quadratic with a simple bound constraint: f(X)=sum(X)^2 with X &gt;= 0 where X is an N-dimensional vector. In the end, I don&rsquo;t want to work with such a simple function, but it is a good simple test to see if the method is really working or not. Here is how the function looks with N=2:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And if we restrict to x,y &gt;= 0 it becomes:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I suspected an error in my program, so I decided to try with scilab, that has also the Box method as part of their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->neldermead_search<!-- raw HTML omitted --> functionality. Scilab also failed to compute the minimum in 8 dimensions of my simple quadratic. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I tried various settings, without ever obtaining a decent result (I expect to find a value near 0).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is another algorithm that can find a global minimum, also very popular: the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Differential Evolution<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. At first, being a genetic algorithm, you would think it would be complicated to write. But no, the main loop is around 20 lines.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Those 20 lines are a bit more difficult than Nelder-Mead, but still, when I saw that, I understood that &ldquo;this is a classic algorithm&rdquo;. And it does work with constraints easily. How to do this is explained well in K. Price book &ldquo;Differential Evolution&rdquo;, and takes only a few lines of code. Here is the result I got in dimension 29:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->dim=29 min=1.2601854176573729E-12 genMax=412 x=[3.340096901536317E-8, 8.889252404343621E-8, 7.163904251807348E-10, 9.71847877381699E-9, 2.7423324674150668E-8, 2.4022269439114537E-9, 1.7336434478718816E-11, 7.244238163901778E-9, 1.0013136274729337E-8, 7.412154679865083E-9, 5.4694460144807974E-9, 2.3682413086417524E-9, 4.241739250073559E-7, 4.821920889534676E-10, 2.115396281722523E-9, 8.750883007882899E-8, 2.512011485133975E-9, 4.811507109129279E-9, 1.0752997894113096E-7, 5.120475258343548E-9, 8.404448964497456E-9, 4.1062290228305595E-9, 1.7030766521603753E-8, 5.589430643552073E-9, 8.237098544820173E-10, 3.5796523161196554E-9, 5.186299547466997E-9, 2.430326342762937E-7, 5.493850433494286E-9]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It works well, although there is quite a bit of parameters.

  <p>After the upgrate to Ubuntu 11.04 I was directly on Unity. Having a dock on the left side is nice, but unfortunately, it has various bugs which makes it sometimes annoying. Also the menu on top like Mac Os X is not a bad idea, but it breaks many apps (for example Picasa). Then there is the scrollbar insanity, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to click on to scroll, and again breaks in some apps (for example Eclipse). Fortunately one can disable all of that and go back to the old Gnome 2.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then I decided to try Gnome 3 the past 2 weeks. I was curious that Linus found it so bad. At first it looked nice, probably because it&rsquo;s different. But very quickly, it becomes annoying: the full screen changed just to switch window with the mouse is a stupid idea. And then installing Gnome 3 in Ubuntu is not such a great idea: Rhythmbox does not work well anymore with it, all my &ldquo;file open&rdquo; mapping was gone and replaced with garbage: why does it propose GIMP to open a PDF is beyond me.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gnome 2 + a nice standard dock + widgets (or the nice unity indicators) + an indexer would have been perfect. Now I am back to KDE 4 which provides all of that, even if it feels a bit bloated.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

  <p>Finally someone who shares the same opinion on the current state of GPGPU programming. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Carmack: On the other hand, we have converted all of our offline processing stuff to ray tracing. For years, the back-end MegaTexture generation for Rage was done with&hellip; we had a GPGPU cluster with NVIDIA cards and it was such a huge pain to keep. It was an amazing pain where one system would be having heat problems and would be behaving weird even though we thought they had identical drivers. Something would always be wrong with render farm 12, and whenever we wanted to put in new features it was like “Okay, writing new fragment programs to go into this.” Now, granted I did this just when CUDA was in its infancy. If I did re-implement it with OpenCL or CUDA we wouldn’t have some of these problems, but when I converted all these over to ray tracing there was a number of things that got a lot better. Things that we deal with, [for example] shadows and reflections that have to be approximated, and were so used to doing with rasterization&hellip; we sometimes forget how big of hacks these are. To be able to say I really just want that ray, and tell me what it hit; not do a projection with feathering shadowed edges and whatever the heck else we’re doing there, so much of the code got so much easier. If it’s a choice of&hellip; now that we have these awesome multi-core x86 CPUs where we can get 24 threads in commodity boxes&hellip; it’s true that one GPU card can do more ray tracing than one 24 thread x86 box, but it’s not multiples more and if it’s just a matter of buying more $2000 boxes, it makes the development, maintenance, and upkeep much better. While everyone in high performance computing is all “rah-rah” GPUs right now, I’ve come full circle back around to saying the fact that we can get massive amounts of x86 cores and threads&hellip; it wont win on FLOPS/watt or FLOPS/volume, but in terms of results per developer hour it is much, much better.</p>
