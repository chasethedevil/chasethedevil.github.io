      <p>These days we tried to make Websphere and <a href="http://jonas.objectweb.org">Jonas</a> interoperate. Some EJBs are deployed in Jonas and we just try to call them from Websphere. The most natural way is to use RMI (with JRMP) for that. Jonas uses  JDK1.4.2 (conforms to J2EE 1.4) and Websphere IBM JVM 1.3.1 (conforms to J2EE 1.3). Because of RMI serialization, an EJB from Jonas will not work on Websphere, because this EJB has references to J2EE 1.4 classes which are different from J2EE  1.3. The exact root cause is not exactly clear to me, it probably has to do with the Naming Factory and the EJB Stub, but we tried every possible thing here without success.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update: </span>JRMP worked between JBoss 3.X on JDK 1.4 and Websphere 5.X (IBM JDK 1.3) using JBoss NamingFactory. So RMI interoperation seems quite unpredictable. One thing is that you have to pay attention to the naming factory you use. If it is a special library like in JBoss case, make sure it is compatible with your JDK.<br /><br />One solution is to use RMI-IIOP, as it does not rely on serialization. It almost works. In our case we use Websphere Portal that needs to have security enabled. You might ask what security has to do with all that. Well, enabling security on websphere means that CORBA exchange will also be secured (using CSIv2). Tuning Jonas to understand what websphere asks is something we did not manage to do (and we don&rsquo;t know if it is possible at all).<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update: </span>We did manage to make it work by disabling Jonas CSIv2 support.<br /><br />So there we are using Axis to do the communication!<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update: </span>Axis is not needed anymore  as RMI-IIOP works as advertised.<br /><br />There is an interesting <a href="http://www.lifl.fr/%7Emerle/benchmarking.pdf">benchmark of Axis vs JRMP vs RMI-IIOP (pdf)</a>. Axis is more than 10x slower than pure JRMP. Application servers use of JRMP seems to matter a lot, JBoss looks bad.</p>

I don't know if I am the only one here but I don't fully understand his post and arguments.<br> <br> Clustering the web server and clustering the model are just two parts of clustering, not exclusive. </span></p>     <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="" lang="EN-US">In a LAMP application, clustering the model is traditionally done by clustering the DB (MySQL) which is a no brainer.

For many web apps this works well. </span></p>         <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="" lang="EN-US">For more stateful web apps, there are strategies to avoid clustering the session, you can make one client attack one server only for his whole session duration. Another strategy is to use DB where you would use a session. This is actually reported to work quite well. If my memory is right, this is how Friendster rewrote its app (used to be Java and session based, moved to PHP+DB).<br> <br> EJBs are not about clustering the model more than Spring, they are about clustering the business logic. And I don't see how EJB3 is more scalable than Hibernate.</span></p>

It&rsquo;s not that easy to find relevant tests. Many people claim to be able to notice huge differences between CD and MP3 and yet, but confronted to a blind listening test, they are very surprised how difficult it actually is. Hydrogenaudio has a good community of audiophiles.<br> <br> Unfortunately Ogg is not supported officially in iTunes and not supported in the most popular hardware (iPod). It&rsquo;s been a while now Ogg is out, and even if it is a superior format, unless Apple embraces it, I don&rsquo;t see it succeeding. I wish Apple would make a tiny effort.<br> <br> In Java it is possible to play ogg files using <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/jorbis/">Jorbis</a> but I did not find any useable Java player compared to Windows foobar2000 or Linux XMMS or Apple iTunes. <br> <br> <br></p>

      <p>Once in a job interview, someone asked me &quot;What&rsquo;s your favorite design pattern?&quot;. I was first surprised at the question. Usually a design pattern is about solving a problem not about a personal preference. I wondered if it was a trick question of some sorts. I was hesitating with my answer and asked more about the meaning of the question. I just had to really give the pattern I liked the most! I really should not have but I ended up pleasing my interviewer and said &quot;the decorator pattern&quot;. At least its name is somehow related to arts. <br> <br> Then he said his favorite one was &quot;the template pattern&quot;. He was really into it because he could use it anywhere. For him it was like the best thing since sliced bread. <br> <br> Sheesh! just an abstract class. What kind of pattern is that!?! Design Patterns discussions can be really dull.<br></p>

      <p>I just finished reading <span style="font-style: italic;">Professional Portal Development With Open Source Tools</span> (Wiley).<br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br> The Good:</span><br> <br> I enjoyed Chapter 1, it gives a good presentation of Portlets for someone who does not know much about it. It is a chapter one can use as a reference to verify some specific details of how Portlets are working. It is a bit similar to JSR 168 specifications, but I found it more detailed and well written.<br> <br> Beside Chapter 1, there are here and there useful information:<br> <ul>   <li>A presentation of Model 1 and 2(X) Architectures in relation with Portals. It could have been more detailed.<br>   </li>   <li>Example use of some Design Patterns in a Portal although the example use is really just one sentence and some Patterns uses are too obvious and not related to Portal (Singleton, Template Method).<br>   </li>   <li>Web Services for Remote Portlets.<br>   </li> </ul> <br style="font-weight: bold;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Bad And Ugly:<br> <br> </span> I was disappointed by the remaining of the book. While it is good to mention Lucene, Apache James, OJB, Jakarta Slide, as those can be useful in Portal development, the book does not provide any useful information on those products. It would be difficult to put all that in just one book. The author merely gives kind of hello world examples for each technology, which I find quite useless.<br> <br> A quick presentation of software methodologies is again quite useless, and not what we expect from that kind of book. If I want to learn about software methodologies, I buy a book about it, I don&rsquo;t buy a Portal Development book. <br> <br> The rest of the book really looks like a list of disconnected subjects, the important ones are not given more attention to the non-relevant ones. Portal Navigation is a problem you will encounter in any Portal development, but you won&rsquo;t find much in the book except a short example. The author also writes with way too many words for the content about CVS, Subversion, JUnit, AntHill, Scarab. And then he goes on about Java Web Start, woohoo! Yes, it almost reads as well as a resume full of keywords.<br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary:<br> <br> </span>Don&rsquo;t buy this book.<br><span class="technoratitag">Tags: <a target=_top href="http://del.icio.us/tag/book" rel="tag">book</a> <a target=_top href="http://del.icio.us/tag/review" rel="tag">review</a></span></p>

      <p>I digged a bit deeper in a current project where they use IBM Websphere Portal Server (WPS) with IBM Web Content Management (WCM). I found out that both products collide and disintegrate.<br> <br> WCM is like a regular content management system, quite flexible and performant on its own. It has a nice way to separate layout concern from content concern. It has a flexible cache. It has a user repository to set different permissions. Its architecture is even so well done (very modular) that you can tailor it to your needs to do things a content management system is not supposed to do. It could do most of what you would do with a Portal system. And that&rsquo;s the problem.<br> <br> WPS is a Porlet server, now compatible with JSR 168. You can again do the layout of your portlets, you have an administrative interface to handle them and one to handle user permissions. There is a caching system although it&rsquo;s not very clear how that works. Standard administration Portlets seem awfully slow to use any cache. To be integrate WCM content in the Portal Server, they ship a WCM Portlet. While JSR 168 API is recommended by IBM, the WCM Portlet is not a JSR 168 one.<br> <br> So you have 2 products where you can layout your pages, and have dynamic behaviour in them, locally as components, easily manageable. One can be embedded in the other, but it does not make much sense, because you would then just use a tiny part of its possibilities, and its flexibility will be more a burden (extra abstraction layer) than anything. The integration of the 2 products is very superficial. Although recently they can share a common user repository, the WCM portlet does not do any caching of WCM content, linking between content and portlets is a very cumbersome task. IBM provides tips to build a framework that does just that. All that for not using most of the WCM possibilities and always having difficulties in defining their roles and using them collaboratively.<br> <br> Now, if you look at how JBoss Portal works, and what features they focused on, you will see a well designed solution whose aim is to build pragmatically a Portal using Portlets. They have a very simple content management system used to administrate HTML snippets. Content is put inside the Portal page using CMS Portlets, the layout is the one you specified in the Portal page. They provide automatic caching of CMS content and easy to use links. Integration with their CMS is already using JSR 170 standard. You can plugin other CMS systems easily.<br> <br> IBM strategy with their WPS+CMS does not look very good, and their version is currently 5.1, soon 6.<br></p>

      <p>Recently, I have had my first encounter with <a href="http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/portalserver/reference/techart/jsr168/">Portlets</a> although Portlets are not very new. IBM had their own Portlet API before the JSR 168 was final in 2003. Unfortunately both approaches are quite different and IBM does not recommend the use of their own API.<br> <br> Portlets were a needed concept for a long time. I worked in 2000 on a java portal system and it would have been handy at that time. Portals are everywhere since the internet bubble. <br> <br> But Portlets do not do that much either. Sites designed with strict and intelligent rules can bypass the portlets need for example by using a combination of custom tags and java beans.<br> <br> What shocks me a bit more is that while not doing much, it looks a bit old fashioned already. With AJAX you could build very flexible and user-friendly Portlets replacement. This AJAX-let is actually probably what Microsoft has already done on their <a href="http://www.start.com/">start.com</a> web site. Now with AJAX, I just wish Javascript would evolve (a lot) or die to be more OO friendly.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br></p>

      <p>A friend asked me for a list, here is it. I found those books the most interesting ones among those I have read about software in the past year or two:<br> <ul>   <li><i>Artificial Intelligence through Prolog</i>, by Neil C. Rowe (Prentice-Hall): if you don&rsquo;t remember much about Prolog, it&rsquo;s a good book. It details how Prolog interpreters work.</li>   <li><i>File Systems Forensic Analysis, </i>by Brian Carrier (Addison Wesley): everything you need to know about disks and file systems, every trick to recover lost data. To go more in depth into file systems theory, you can read the free <i><a  href="http://www.nobius.org/%7Edbg/">Practical File System Design with the Be File System</a> </i>from D. Giampaolo, the creator of BeFS.<br>   </li>   <li><i>Mind Hacks </i>(O&rsquo;Reilly): you probably already bought that one. Not about software, but excellent.<br>   </li>   <li><i>Practical Issues in Database Management</i> by Fabian Pascal (Addison Wesley): short but concise book on relational database theory. F Pascal is of CJ Date school of thoughts, &ldquo;null are evil&rdquo;. You don&rsquo;t need to read it if you have read any other similar book (by CJ Date for example).<br>   </li>   <li><i>Inside The Java Virtual Machine,</i> by Bill Venners (McGraw-Hill): there are other books on the same subject. While this book has some bad reviews, I found it an easy read, and it explain well enough for me all the inner details of Java. I found &ldquo;Programming for the Java Virtual Machine&rdquo; not better, and with some bad example of a Prolog language for the JVM (1 full chapter for this to present a way too simple thing to be of any use).</li>   <li><i>Programming Jabber</i>, by O&rsquo;Reilly: I have read it 2 years ago, I enjoyed how they made you go through building a Jabber server.</li>   <li><i>Lucene In Action</i>: the only book about Lucene, some of the info is useful to understand how it is designed.</li>   <li><i>Hibernate In Action:</i> if you have to use hibernate, this is the book to read. It presents different ways of using it.</li>   <li>some Javascript+DHTML(+CSS) book: useful if you have none. They often have good tricks to solve the usual problems. In the AJAX days, it becomes useful again. I find O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Javascript - The Definitive Guide</i>&rdquo; good to have an API reference (as ebook), and &ldquo;<i>Javascript and DHTML Cookbook</i>&rdquo; has the most useful recipes.</li>   <li><i>Lean Software Development </i>by Poppendieck (Addison Wesley): easy to read, good presentation of software dev management problems and pragmatic solutions. My favorite on the subject. Another good one but very specific is &ldquo;<i>Requirements Management</i>&rdquo; (MS Press).</li>   <li><i>UML Distilled </i>by M Fowler: always useful to have if you need to draw UML diagrams.</li> </ul> <br> Good luck!<br><span class="technoratitag">Tags: <a target=_top href="http://del.icio.us/tag/book" rel="tag">book</a> <a target=_top href="http://del.icio.us/tag/review" rel="tag">review</a></span></p>

      <p>I find the mac mini a particularly compelling computer. It is small, noise friendly, relatively cheap. If you want to have a cheap home server (based on Linux or MacOS X), this is quite a good choice as you probably don&rsquo;t want to hear all the fans of bigger computers the whole day. It&rsquo;s also a very good candidate for a media box: you can connect a huge hard drive for mp3s, and watch your DVDs, photos on a nice LCD (and MacOS helps here).<br> <br> Unfortunately it might not be the best moment to buy it now. There are rumors everywhere that the first Mac Intel will be presented in January. And I am quite confident that this Mac Intel will be the Mac Mini. Here are the reasons:<br> <ul>   <li>PowerMacs and iMacs use the quite modern G5 processor. It makes sense to update the very old G4 to Intel first.</li>   <li>if iBook was updated, it would be much more attractive than the Powerbook.</li> </ul> This leaves us with either powerbook upgrade or mac mini upgrade, but:<br> <ul>   <li>XBox 360 has almost arrived. While not a direct competitor, it can be used as media center, it is cheap and powerful. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s not customizable enough.</li>   <li>Powerbooks got a recent update. They are advertised heavily on apple websites, while the mac mini had just a silent and minor upgrade and is not advertised anymore.</li> </ul> <br> <span class="technoratitag">Tags: <a  href="http://del.icio.us/tag/apple" rel="tag">apple</a>, <a  href="http://del.icio.us/tag/mac" rel="tag">mac</a>, <a  href="http://del.icio.us/tag/intel" rel="tag">intel</a>, <a  href="http://del.icio.us/tag/rumors" rel="tag">rumors</a></span><br> <br> <br></p>
