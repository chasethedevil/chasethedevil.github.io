      <p>Today, I just found out about <a  href="http://dpml.net/transit/latest/overview.html">DPML Transit</a>, it is a small framework that helps you build plug-ins based software. It seems to work a bit with <a  href="http://dpml.net/magic/latest/index.html">DPML Magic</a>, their build system based upon Ant. Both are quite interesting, since in big projects, you often end up with a packaging per component (which DPML Magic seems to make very simple) and a versioning of those components. DPML Transit allows then for an efficient way to look up a particular version of one component.<br> <br> I have not heard of DPML before, they seem to write useful software. Has anybody used those frameworks already?<br> <br> <span class="technoratitag">Tags: <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/java"  rel="tag">java</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/framework"  rel="tag">framework</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/programming"  rel="tag">programming</a></span><br></p>

I don&rsquo;t think anyone can get every puzzle right. This shows again how you can very easily make someone fail interviews if you ask too silly questions. I suppose that if people were asking those questions they would not expect the right answers, but study the candidate reactions.<br /><br />Here is a sample:<br /><br /><tt>public class DosEquis {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char x = &lsquo;X&rsquo;;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int i = 0;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.print(true ? x : 0);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.print(false ? i : x);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />} </tt><br /><br />This will output &ldquo;X88&rdquo;. Obviously this is not good code, which is precisely one of the book objectives: to show how bad some practices can be. But at the same time you learn a bit more about the Java language and its possibilities. In the latter chapters they have more interesting puzzles.<br /><br /><span class="technoratitag">Tags: <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/java" rel="tag">java</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/book" rel="tag">book</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/review" rel="tag">review</a></span></p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Sep 26, 2005 &middot; 2 minute read

      <p>I am currently reading a Prolog book &ldquo;<i>Artificial Intelligence Through Prolog</i>&rdquo;, I have been doing a bit of Prolog when I was very young and wanted to refresh my memory a bit. It is a very interesting read, especially when I take the viewpoint of our current application where no ACID compliance is required.<br /><br />It seems to me that all the logic we coded to parametrize SQL queries and construct them dynamically could have been avoided if we had chosen Prolog as Prolog expressions would have been very natural to use in our project. With Prolog, there is no need to think about joins, type of joins, SQL syntax. It is at the level just higher. I wonder very much why Prolog did not become more mainstream as it seems to solve some problems in a much nicer, natural way.<br />Here is a short example to get reviews of things by user or by user and tags or &hellip;:<br /><ol>   <li>let&rsquo;s define some facts:<br />  </li>   <ul>     <li>is_tag(tag1, user1, thing_id)</li>     <li>is_tag(tag2, user1, thing_id)</li>     <li>&hellip;<br />    </li>     <li>review(user1, thing_id, description, extended, date)</li>     <li>&hellip;<br />    </li>   </ul>   <li>review for user &ldquo;user_x&rdquo;</li>   <ul>     <li>?review(user_x, THING_ID, DESC, EXT, DATE)<br />    </li>   </ul>   <li>review for user &ldquo;user_x&rdquo; with tag &ldquo;tag_y&rdquo;</li>   <ul>     <li>?review(user_x, THING_ID, DESC, EXT, DATE), is_tag(tag_y, user_x, THING_ID)</li>   </ul> </ol> We could imagine some better ways to lay out information. This is just a first draft.<br /><br />Now of course, Prolog does not necessary makes sense for us because:<br />  a) We already have it working in SQL<br />  b) SQL is much more used and should therefore be more tunable, stable, etc.<br /><br />Still the Prolog way of things is interesting and powerful. We could have written a code with a logic near Prolog instead of our custom code.<br /><span class="technoratitag">Tags: <a target=_top href="http://del.icio.us/tag/book" rel="tag">book</a> <a target=_top href="http://del.icio.us/tag/review" rel="tag">review</a></span></p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Sep 16, 2005 &middot; 2 minute read
      </span>
      
      <p>In <a href="http://bamboo-dht.org/">bamboo-dht</a>, a distributed java hashtable project, the main developer, Sean C. Rhea, advocates the use of Curries and Thunks (of LISP and ML). He wrote an interesting and valuable document, <a href="http://bamboo-dht.org/async-tutorial/async-tutorial.pdf">Async Tutorial</a>, presenting a use of it. I will present the concept here shortly:<br /><br /><tt>public interface Thunk1&lt;T&gt; { void run (T t ) ; }<br /><br />Thunk1&lt;Integer&gt; intThunk = new Thunk1&lt;Integer&gt;() {<br />void run (Integer i ) { System.out.println( i ) ; }<br />}<br /><br />public static &lt;T&gt; Runnable curry(final Thunk1&lt;T&gt; f ,final T t ) {<br />return new Runnable () { public void run ( ) { f.run ( t ) ; } } ;<br />}<br /><br />Runnable print42  = curry( intThunk , new Integer ( 42 ) ) ;<br />print42.run ( ) ;  //prints 42 to standard output</tt><br /><br />So it is a very clever way to have a callback in java. Very clever because you can declare your code to take only a run(), and pass any parameter in it by using a curry. It is very simple to use, even if the small framework around it can scare some people.<br /><br />However neat the idea is, I am not sure it is practically useful. Sean C. Rhea used that because he did not want to use &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; instance variables. Ok, but the curry is still creating another instance (actually 2 but one could be static), is the overhead of a class instance without variables that much more than one with variables? And there is another way, without the Curry framework:<br /><tt><br />Runnable print42 = new Runnable({ public void run() {intThunk.run(new Integer(42));}});</tt><br /><tt>print42.run();</tt><br /><br />This is actually exactly what the Curry framework would do behind the scenes. The Curry framework makes it a bit more elegant, but I am not sure if that&rsquo;s really more readable for most programmers. I would personally advise the traditional way, use instance variables.<br /><br /><span class="technoratitag">Tags: <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/java" rel="tag">java</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/programming" rel="tag">programming</a></span></p>

      <p>Brian Alexander Lee <a  href="http://www.prepend.com/2005/09/porting-j2ee-apps-to-websphere.html">wrote</a>:<br> &ldquo;dismal interview where I asked about the candidate&rsquo;s experience with porting a J2EE application from WebLogic to WebSphere (which was listed on his resume). The candidate said that it was very easy and he just deployed his application with no problems or changes necessary, he had no changes made for the application to run properly. This was one of many bad signs for the candidate.&rdquo;<br> <br> I disagree. I would even use his example to show that the portability game is more about configuration and packaging rather than about anything else so that many developers would in-deed not see a big deal into porting an application to a new application server.<br> <br> You can make a port to Websphere or Weblogic quite transparent if you externalize the JNDI strings (for example in properties file), which is anyway what you should do. Repeating a same string everywhere in your code is bad practice in Java.<br> The most problematic is usually the packaging, weblogic and websphere, for example used to manage the jar dependencies a different way (websphere being very strict, weblogic a bit more practicle). And actually JNDI settings, DataSources and Security should boil down to packaging problems, which is why, I think, your candidate did not know of any problem unless he worked on the packaging of the app.<br> <br> Recruitment is no easy task. I did not find yet a magic formula for it, except maybe, try the person for a month. Personality is more important than knowing technical details. I am not sure if one can see if a person is serious, rigorous, and reasonably fast in an interview.<br></p>

      <p>I took some time to continue my little JavaBlogs analysis, I now have a page summarizing the <a href="http://gopix.net:8081/javabuzz/buzzweek.html">top 10</a> most read blog entries in the last week. The page is generated every 24h (this is why there is no &lsquo;best progression&rsquo; as of today).<br/><br/> I also fixed some bugs related to HTML in RSS2. I understand a bit better why a RSS 1.0 co-author decided to remove the possibility of HTML descriptions for <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/rss30">RSS 3.0</a>. It often does not make sense to keep all that information about styles, fonts, etc. from different sources. What I do is rewrite the HTML, allowing only b,i,a,p,br tags, with the style information stripped. I found the open-source <a href="http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net">htmlparser </a>java library quite helpful to achieve that.<br/><br/><strong><font color="red">Mai 2006 Update</font><br/>I now post the top10 every week to my blog, I wrote a little piece on <a href="http://chasethedevil.blogspot.com/2006/04/how-to-use-java-with-blogger-tutorial.html">how to interact with Blogger API in Java</a>. This avoids me having to maintain an extra site.<br/>HTTP requests handling is done using commons-httpclient library to have more control  over how http requests to javablogs.com are performed. commons-httpclient is also useful to post to blogger. About the parsing with htmlparser, I changed the way to do it, I used to only use a simple Lexer, but now I changed to using NodeVisitor as it allows me to parse with finer granularity more easily, even though it is probably slower. I needed that to update  href elements to that they are XHTML compliant.<br/><br/>You will find <a href="http://chasethedevil.blogspot.com/2006/05/java-html-parsing-example-with.html">concrete code using htmlparser</a> in a more recent post,  just follow the link.<a href="http://chasethedevil.blogspot.com/2006/05/java-html-parsing-example-with.html"> </a> <br/><br/> <span class="technoratitag">Categories: <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/javablogs" rel="tag">javablogs</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/rss3" rel="tag">rss3</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/java" rel="tag">java</a></span><br/></span></strong></p>

      <p>I was wondering what blog entries were the most interesting on <a  href="http://www.javablogs.com">Javablogs</a>. I decided to write a small application to do that. It was not much more complex to put it online for others to look at as well. It is currently running on <a  href="http://gopix.net:8081/javabuzz"><a href="http://gopix.net:8081/javabuzz">http://gopix.net:8081/javabuzz</a></a> <br> <br> It also presents Javablogs a bit differently (I like it better that way).<br> <br> Please note that it is just the result of a 1 (full) day of work currently. I hopefully will have a bit of time to improve it. For example I&rsquo;d like to add some graphs about popularity, some weekly stats, and comments in blog entries.<br> <br> <br></p>

      <p>The <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/beanutils/commons-beanutils-1.7.0/docs/api/">BeanUtil.popupate(bean,map)</a> can be very handy, but if you care about performance, it is quite slow. I ran a micro benchmark on my machine (centrino 1.8ghz, JDK1.5) and found out that BeanUtils is up to 40x slower than a hand coded solution (where I assign each bean field manually). I was a bit surprised to find such a difference. I suppose there is a big penalty for using reflection and another big one for the BeanUtils abstraction (automatic casting, etc.). I did another test without BeanUtils, using if/else statements vs HashMap.get and found out that the if/else string.equals(&hellip;) statements can degrade performance by about 10x. The HashMap appears to be very performant, even with just a few elements in.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you need more performance, consider hand coding or code generation (using aspectj, or annotations for example) rather than BeanUtils. Actually nowadays, using annotations where you used beanutils probably makes much more sense .</p>
