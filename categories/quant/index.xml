      <title>The VIX starts smiling</title>

      <description>The VIX implied volatilities used to look like a logarithmic function of the strikes. I don&amp;rsquo;t look at them often, but today, I noticed that the VIX had the start of a smile shape. 1m VIX implied volatilities on March 21, 2017 with strictly positive volume. Very few strikes trades below the VIX future level (12.9). All of this is likely because the VIX is unusually low: not many people are looking to trade it much lower. <a href="/post/vix-starts-smiling/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>When SVI Breaks Down</title>

      <description>In order to fit the implied volatility smile of equity options, one of the most popular parameterization is Jim Gatheral&amp;rsquo;s SVI, which I have written about before here. It turns out that in the current market conditions, SVI does not work well for short maturities. SPX options expiring on March 24, 2017 (one week) offer a good example. I paid attention to include only options with non zero volume, that is options that are actually traded. <a href="/post/when-svi-breaks-down/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Brownian Bridge and Discrete Random Variables</title>

      <description>The new Heston discretisation scheme I wrote about a few weeks ago makes use a discrete random variable matching the first five moments of the normal distribution instead of the usual normally distributed random variable, computed via the inverse cumulative distribution function. Their discrete random variable is: $$\xi = \sqrt{1-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}} \quad \text{ if } U_1 &amp;lt; 3\,,$$ $$ \xi =-\sqrt{1-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}} \quad \text{ if } U_1 &amp;gt; 4\,,$$ $$\xi = \sqrt{1+\sqrt{6}} \quad \text{ if } U_1 = 3\,,$$ $$\xi = -\sqrt{1+\sqrt{6}} \quad \text{ if } U_1 = 4\,,$$ with \(U_1 \in \{0,1,&amp;hellip;,7\}\) The advantage of the discrete variable is that it is much faster to generate. <a href="/post/brownian-bridge-and-discrete-sampling/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>A new scheme for Heston - Part 2</title>

      <description>A couple weeks ago, I wrote about a new Heston discretisation scheme which was at least as accurate as Andersen QE scheme and faster, called DVSS2. It turns out that it does not behave very well on the following Vanilla forward start option example (which is quite benign). The Heston parameters comes from a calibration to the market and are $$v_0= 0.0718, \kappa= 1.542, \theta= 0.0762, \sigma= 0.582, \rho= -0.352$$ with a maturity of one year. <a href="/post/a-new-scheme-for-heston_part2/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Equivalence between floating-strike and fixed-strike Asian options</title>
      <link>http://chasethedevil.github.io/post/floating_strike_fixed_strike_asian_equivalence/</link>

      <description>Many papers present formulae to price Asian options in the Black-Scholes world only for the fixed strike Asian case, that is a contract that pays \( \max(A-K,0)\) at maturity \(T\) where \(A = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w_i S(t_i) \) is the Asian average. More generally, this can be seen as the payoff of a Basket option where the underlyings are just the same asset but at different times. And any Basket option formula can actually be used to price fixed-strike Asian options by letting the correlation correspond to the correlation between the asset at the averaging times and the variances correspond to the variance at each averaging time. <a href="/post/floating_strike_fixed_strike_asian_equivalence/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Bachelier Normal Volatility Asymptotics</title>

      <description>It is relatively well known that the Black-Scholes volatility can not grow faster than \(\sqrt{\ln(K)}\). The rule is also sometimes simply stated as &amp;ldquo;the implied variance can not grow faster than linear&amp;rdquo; (in log-moneyness). The proof comes from Roger Lee &amp;ldquo;The moment formula for implied volatility at extreme strikes&amp;rdquo; but the rule was suggested earlier, for example in Hodge&amp;rsquo;s paper from 1996 &amp;ldquo;Arbitrage bounds of the implied volatility strike and term structures of European-style options&amp;rdquo;. <a href="/post/normal_volatility_asymptotics/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <description>I stumbled recently upon a new Heston discretisation scheme, in the spirit of Alfonsi, not more complex and more accurate. My first attempt at coding the scheme resulted in a miserable failure even though the described algorithm looked not too difficult. I started wondering if the paper, from a little known Lithuanian mathematical journal, was any good. Still, the math in it is very well written, with a great emphasis on the settings for each proposition. <a href="/post/a-new-scheme-for-heston/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Andreasen-Huge interpolation - Don&#39;t stay flat</title>

      <description>Jesper Andreasen and Brian Huge propose an arbitrage-free interpolation method based on a single-step forward Dupire PDE solution in their paper Volatility interpolation. To do so, they consider a piecewise constant representation of the local volatility in maturity time and strike where the number of constants matches the number of market option prices. An interesting example that shows some limits to the technique as described in Jesper Andreasen and Brian Huge paper comes from Nabil Kahale paper on an arbitrage-free interpolation of volatilities. <a href="/post/dont-stay-flat-with-andreasen-huge-interpolation/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Put-Call parity and the log-transformed Black-Scholes PDE</title>

      <description>We will assume zero interest rates and no dividends on the asset \(S\) for clarity. The results can be easily generalized to the case with non-zero interest rates and dividends. Under those assumptions, the Black-Scholes PDE is: $$ \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} = 0.$$ An implicit Euler discretisation on a uniform grid in \(S\) of width \(h\) with linear boundary conditions (zero Gamma) leads to: $$ V^{k+1}_i - V^{k}_i = \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 \Delta t S_i^2 \frac{V^{k}_{i+1}-2V^k_{i}+V^{k}_{i-1}}{h^2}.$$ for \(i=1,&amp;hellip;,m-1\) with boundaries $$ V^{k+1}_i - V^{k}_i = 0.$$ for \(i=0,m\). <a href="/post/put_call_parity_with_log_transformed_pde/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Benaim et al. extrapolation does not work on equities</title>
      <link>http://chasethedevil.github.io/post/issues_with_bdk_extrapolation/</link>

      <description>We have seen earlier that a simple parabola allows to capture the smile of AAPL 1m options surprisingly well. For very high and very low strikes, the parabola does not obey Lee&amp;rsquo;s moments formula (the behavior in the wings needs to be at most linear in variance/log-moneyness). Extrapolating the volatility smile in the low or high strikes in a smooth \(C^2\) fashion is however not easy. A surprisingly popular so called &amp;ldquo;arbitrage-free&amp;rdquo; method is the extrapolation of Benaim, Dodgson and Kainth developed to remedy the negative density of SABR in interest rates as well as to give more control over the wings. <a href="/post/issues_with_bdk_extrapolation/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.
