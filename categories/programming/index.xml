      <description>A few years ago, when Git was rising fast and SVN was already not hype anymore, a friend thought that SVN was for many organizations better suited than Git, with the following classical arguments, which were sound at the time:
 Who needs decentralization for a small team or a small company working together? ‎SVN is proven, works well and is simple to use and put in place.  Each argument is in reality not so strong. <a href="/post/svn_is_dead/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2018 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <description>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are the current hype (again). In their new Ryzen processors, AMD advertises the Neural Net Prediction. It turns out this is was already used in their older (2012) Piledriver architecture used for example in the AMD A10-4600M. It is also present in recent Samsung processors such as the one powering the Galaxy S7. What is it really?
The basic idea can be traced to a paper from Daniel Jimenez and Calvin Lin &amp;ldquo;Dynamic Branch Prediction with Perceptrons&amp;rdquo;, more precisely described in the subsequent paper &amp;ldquo;Neural methods for dynamic branch prediction&amp;rdquo;. <a href="/post/the_neural_network_in_your_cpu/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2018 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.
