      <description>In their paper &amp;ldquo;Nonnegativity-, Monotonicity-, or Convexity-Preserving Cubic and Quintic Hermite Interpolation&amp;rdquo;, Dougherty, Edelman and Hyman present a simple filter on the first derivatives to maintain positivity of a cubic spline interpolant.
Unfortunately, in their main formula for non-negativity, they made a typo: the equation (3.3) is not consistent with the equation (3.1): the \Delta x_{i-1&amp;frasl;2} is interverted with \Delta x_{i+1&amp;frasl;2}.
It was not obvious to find out which equation was wrong since there is no proof in the paper. <a href="/post/typo-in-hyman-non-negative-constraint/">Read Moreâ€¦</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.
