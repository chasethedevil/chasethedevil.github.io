    <h1>Switching to Windows</h1>
    <span class="post-date">Jan 25, 2007 &middot; 3 minute read
    </span>
    <p>That&#39;s it, I have done it, the unthinkable. I have switched from MacOs X to Windows XP. My idea was first to install Ubuntu on the Mac Mini, but if you want to keep the Mac Os X install, the methods I have read on the web required to use bootcamp. At around the same time I was annoyed by problems I had with bluetooth and Skype in MacOs.  <br><br>So, with bootcamp installed I decided to give a try to Windows. And it works quite well on the Mac. As I use it mostly as a media box (movies, photos, jukebox, browser and tablature reader) and not really as a developer, I find Windows quite convenient. I have always preferred Picasa to iPhoto. And moving back to Picasa for my photos is a joy. I can&#39;t believe the speed difference between the two apps, and it&#39;s not a matter of memory, I have 2gb. The crappy ways iPhotos deals with my folders is over. I am also happy to use again foobar2000 instead of bloated (and limited (only MP3s and MP4s)) iTunes. In my quest to look for a convenient setup, I discovered ProjectM visualisation, also available for MacOs X (with iTunes) and Linux. I am quite impressed with the animations. I have the impression that graphics are much faster under Windows than under MacOs, it&#39;s probably due to much better optimized drivers. <br><br>Today I gave a try to Netbeans 6.0. It&#39;s not a dev machine, but I find convenient to sometimes be able modify quickly an existing program, or test some java stuff. It&#39;s still in beta, and it shows, I found it so slow! Plus functionality is really not on par with Eclipse when it comes to code analysis. It reports some errors way too long after I corrected them, and it does not report other important errors, for example when a library requires another library. With Netbeans, you see the library problem only at runtime. Under Eclipse, you have an alert in your project, before running it. <br><br>What&#39;s not working very well is the broken Apple keyboard, I really don&#39;t understand why they changed all the non alphanumeric keys in the French keyboard layout. But it&#39;s broken in MacOs as well, Another thing is the bluetooth headset. Apple bluetooth drivers don&#39;t do that. Anyway Apple bluetooth range in the Mac Mini is a joke. My thinkpad offers a much wider bluetooth range. <br><br>Overall I am quite happy with the current setup, being able to use Picasa, foobar2000, Open Office,.and latest software like Skype 3 or Photoshop 9. And I don&#39;t have to lose any more time with the freaking Finder backward interface. <br></p>
