  <h1>Google phones are overrated</h1>
  <time datetime=2017-10-02T23:56:42&#43;0100 class="post-date">Mon, Oct 2, 2017</time>
  <p>It is a relatively common belief that the vanilla Android experience is better, as it runs smoother. The Samsung Touchwiz is often blamed for making things slow and not more practical.</p>
<p>I have had a Nexus 6 for a couple of years and I noticed the slowdowns after each update, up to a point where it sometimes took a few seconds to open the phone app, or to display the keyboard. I freed up storage, removed some apps but this did not make any difference. This is more or less the same experience that people have with the Samsung devices if <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/73necm/with_the_note_8_samsung_no_longer_delivers/">reddit comments</a> are to be believed.</p>
<p>The other myth is that Google phones will be updated for a longer time. Prior to the Nexus 6, I had a Galaxy Nexus, which Google stopped supporting after less than 2 years. The Nexus 6 received security update until this October, that is nearly 2 years for me and 2.5 years for early buyers.</p>
<p>In comparison Apple updates its phones for much longer and a 4 years old iphone 5s still runs smoothly. Fortunately for Android phones, there are the alternative roms. Being desperate with the state of my Nexus phone, I installed <a href="http://get.aospa.co/">paranoid android</a>. I am surprised at how good it is. My phone feels like new again, and as good as any flagship I would purchase today. To my great surprise I did not find any clear step by step installation process for Paranoid Android. I just followed the <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/shamu/install">detailed steps for LineageOS</a> (CyanogenMod descendent), but with the paranoid android zip file instead of the LineageOS one. I have some trouble to understand how some open source ROM can be much nicer than the pure Google Android ROM, but it is. I have had no crash/reboot (which became more common as well with the years), plus it&rsquo;s still updated regularly. Google does not set a good standard by not supporting its own devices better.</p>
<p>There is however one thing that Google does well, it&rsquo;s the camera app. The HDR+ mode makes my Nexus 6 take great pictures, even compared to new android phones or iphones. I am often amazed at the pictures I manage to take, and others are also amazed at how good they look (especially since they look often better on the Nexus 6 screen than on a computer monitor). Initially I remember the camera to be not so great, but some update that came in 2016 transformed the phone into a fantastic shooter. It allowed me to take very nice pictures in difficult conditions, see for example <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/s2IHVtKMzRkxDY1q1">this google photo gallery</a>. Fortunately it&rsquo;s still possible to install the app in the Google Play store on Paranoid Android. They should really make it open-source and easier to adapt it to other android phones.</p>
