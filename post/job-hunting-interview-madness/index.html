    <h1>Job Hunting: Interview Madness</h1>
    <span class="post-date">Nov 4, 2005 &middot; 3 minute read
    </span>
    <p>I have been doing interviews those past weeks. Today I had to present my resume for the N time where N is big. It is very boring. In France, it is common to have 5 interviews for a small company <small>(that says a bit about how people trust each other and makes me envy Germany where the practice is to select very strictly on the resume and be more relax about interviews)</small>. But all those interviews give a valuable insight on the current market, and on some companies.<br /><br /><b>0. The Monster Rage</b><br /><br />The first 2 days after I put my resume on Monster France, I got more than 15 calls from consulting companies. The following day, I removed my resume from Monster.<br /><br /><br /><b>1. Interviewing People<br /><br /></b>When I started working, I was very bad at interviews, I had a good academic record and thought companies ringing me would have been interested automatically. I supposed most people were dedicated to their work and did not bother doing a show, I was passive. So I often failed the interview process at the HR level.<br /><br />Now I am doing the show everybody expects and it always works. Only one person asked me an unusual, clever question: &ldquo;Do you write?&rdquo; or<br /><big><big><i>&ldquo;Do you like to write?&rdquo;</i></big></big><br /><br />I am often more stressed by technical interviews as I find technical interviews can more easily be very badly done. Even specialists don&rsquo;t agree on a good method, cf the artima article on <a href="http://www.artima.com/wbc/interprogP.html">How to Interview a Programmer</a>. If someone asks you about some intricate details he knows lots about and you don&rsquo;t, or you used to but you don&rsquo;t remember, then that person can have a bad impression of you. In Java, this can be the supposedly trivial ,&ldquo;what classes do you have to implement for an EJB ?&rdquo;. I have done many EJBs in the past, but that was a long time enough that I need to look up somewhere to find the exact and precise answer. It is much better to ask someone about what he recently did, or about someone&rsquo;s view on general subjects, especially subjects he knows about.<br /><br /><b><br />2. Interviewing Companies</b><br /><br />As a junior in the business world, I had a very angelic view of companies. I had been lucky enough to do internships around very good people. But nowadays, I am starting to find difficult to pick a good company to work for. I found one question especially useful to find out more about your future mates:<br /><big><big><i>&ldquo;What do you like in this company?&rdquo;</i></big></big><br />and try to get to know the answer of <i>&ldquo;Why did you go there?&rdquo;</i><br /><br /><br /><b>3. The $$$ in Current Market<br /><br /></b>There seem to be huge disparities in salaries in France. I found consulting companies were very reticent to offer a market salary. More regular companies can either offer a much lower salary than the market one, a market salary, or a much higher one, for the same job!</p>
