      <title>Equivalence between floating-strike and fixed-strike Asian options</title>

      <description>Many papers present formulae to price Asian options in the Black-Scholes world only for the fixed strike Asian case, that is a contract that pays \( \max(A-K,0)\) at maturity \(T\) where \(A = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w_i S(t_i) \) is the Asian average. More generally, this can be seen as the payoff of a Basket option where the underlyings are just the same asset but at different times. And any Basket option formula can actually be used to price fixed-strike Asian options by letting the correlation correspond to the correlation between the asset at the averaging times and the variances correspond to the variance at each averaging time. <a href="/post/floating_strike_fixed_strike_asian_equivalence/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Bachelier Normal Volatility Asymptotics</title>

      <description>It is relatively well known that the Black-Scholes volatility can not grow faster than \(\sqrt{\ln(K)}\). The rule is also sometimes simply stated as &amp;ldquo;the implied variance can not grow faster than linear&amp;rdquo; (in log-moneyness). The proof comes from Roger Lee &amp;ldquo;The moment formula for implied volatility at extreme strikes&amp;rdquo; but the rule was suggested earlier, for example in Hodge&amp;rsquo;s paper from 1996 &amp;ldquo;Arbitrage bounds of the implied volatility strike and term structures of European-style options&amp;rdquo;. <a href="/post/normal_volatility_asymptotics/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>A new scheme for Heston</title>

      <description>I stumbled recently upon a new Heston discretisation scheme, in the spirit of Alfonsi, not more complex and more accurate. My first attempt at coding the scheme resulted in a miserable failure even though the described algorithm looked not too difficult. I started wondering if the paper, from a little known Lithuanian mathematical journal, was any good. Still, the math in it is very well written, with a great emphasis on the settings for each proposition. <a href="/post/a-new-scheme-for-heston/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Andreasen-Huge interpolation - Don&#39;t stay flat</title>

      <description>Jesper Andreasen and Brian Huge propose an arbitrage-free interpolation method based on a single-step forward Dupire PDE solution in their paper Volatility interpolation. To do so, they consider a piecewise constant representation of the local volatility in maturity time and strike where the number of constants matches the number of market option prices. An interesting example that shows some limits to the technique as described in Jesper Andreasen and Brian Huge paper comes from Nabil Kahale paper on an arbitrage-free interpolation of volatilities. <a href="/post/dont-stay-flat-with-andreasen-huge-interpolation/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Put-Call parity and the log-transformed Black-Scholes PDE</title>

      <description>We will assume zero interest rates and no dividends on the asset \(S\) for clarity. The results can be easily generalized to the case with non-zero interest rates and dividends. Under those assumptions, the Black-Scholes PDE is: $$ \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} = 0.$$ An implicit Euler discretisation on a uniform grid in \(S\) of width \(h\) with linear boundary conditions (zero Gamma) leads to: $$ V^{k+1}_i - V^{k}_i = \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 \Delta t S_i^2 \frac{V^{k}_{i+1}-2V^k_{i}+V^{k}_{i-1}}{h^2}.$$ for \(i=1,&amp;hellip;,m-1\) with boundaries $$ V^{k+1}_i - V^{k}_i = 0.$$ for \(i=0,m\). <a href="/post/put_call_parity_with_log_transformed_pde/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Benaim et al. extrapolation does not work on equities</title>

      <description>We have seen earlier that a simple parabola allows to capture the smile of AAPL 1m options surprisingly well. For very high and very low strikes, the parabola does not obey Lee&amp;rsquo;s moments formula (the behavior in the wings needs to be at most linear in variance/log-moneyness). Extrapolating the volatility smile in the low or high strikes in a smooth \(C^2\) fashion is however not easy. A surprisingly popular so called &amp;ldquo;arbitrage-free&amp;rdquo; method is the extrapolation of Benaim, Dodgson and Kainth developed to remedy the negative density of SABR in interest rates as well as to give more control over the wings. <a href="/post/issues_with_bdk_extrapolation/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>AES for Monte-Carlo</title>

      <description>In finance, and also in science, the Mersenne-Twister is the de-factor pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) for Monte-Carlo simulations. By the way, there is a recent 64-bit maximally equidistributed version called MEMT19937 with 53-bit double precision floating point numbers in mind. D.E. Shaw paper Parallel Random Numbers: As easy as 1, 2, 3 makes a bold remark: since specific AES instructions have been available since 2010 in most x86 processors, why not use them? <a href="/post/aes_for_monte_carlo/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>A review of Thomas Piketty - Le capital au XXI siecle</title>

      <description>I found back some old notes I had written about the book &amp;ldquo;Le capital au XXI siecle&amp;rdquo; from Thomas Piketty. It took me a while to finish that book last summer. So many journalists have written around Piketty, that I had to buy the book and read it. It turns out that some of the criticism I have read is not really founded once one reads the book, but here are other real obvious criticisms that I suprisingly did not hear. <a href="/post/piketty_capital/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Number of regressors in a BSDE</title>

      <description>Last year, I was kindly invited at the workshop on Models and Numerics in Financial Mathematics at the Lorentz center. It was surprinsgly interesting on many different levels. Beside the relatively large gap between academia and the industry, which this workshop was trying to address, one thing that struck me is how difficult it was for people of slightly different specialties to communicate. It seemed that mathematicians of different countries working on different subjects related to backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) would not truly understand each other. <a href="/post/number_of_regressors_in_bdse/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.

      <title>Shooting arbitrage - part II</title>

      <description>In my previous post, I looked at de-arbitraging volatilities of options of a specific maturity with the shooting method. In reality it is not so practical. While the local volatility will be continuous at the given expiry \(T\), it won&amp;rsquo;t be so at the times \( t \lt T \) because of the interpolation or extrapolation in time. If we consider a single market expiry at time \(T\), it is standard practice to extrapolate the implied volatility flatly for \(t \lt T\), that is, \(w(y,t) = v_T(y) t\) where the variance at time \(T\) is defined as \(v_T(y)= \frac{1}{T}w(y,T)\). <a href="/post/shooting_arbitrage2/">Read More…</a> <p>Copyright 2006-2016 Fabien Le Floc&#39;h.
