      <title>Variance Swap Term-Structure under Schobel-Zhu</title>

      <description>I never paid too much attention to it, but the term-structure of variance swaps is not always realistic under the Schobel-Zhu stochastic volatility model.
This is not fundamentally the case with the Heston model, the Heston model is merely extremely limited to produce either a flat shape or a downward sloping exponential shape.
Under the Schobel-Zhu model, the price of a newly issued variance swap reads $$	V(T) = \left[\left(v_0-\theta\right)^2-\frac{\eta^2}{2\kappa}\right]\frac{1-e^{-2\kappa T}}{2\kappa T}+2\theta(v_0-\theta)\frac{1-e^{-\kappa T}}{\kappa T}+\theta^2+\frac{\eta^2}{2\kappa},,$$ where \( \eta \) is the vol of vol.</description>

      <title>New Basket Expansions and Cash Dividends</title>

      <description>In the previous post, I presented a new stochastic expansion for the prices of Asian options. The stochastic expansion is generalized to basket options in the paper, and can thus be applied on the problem of pricing vanilla options with cash dividends.
I have updated the paper with comparisons to more direct stochastic expansions for pricing vanilla options with cash dividends, such as the one of Etoré and Gobet, and my own refinement on it.</description>

      <description>Many years ago, I had applied the stochastic expansion technique of Etore and Gobet to a refined proxy, in order to produce more accurate prices for vanilla options with cash dividends under the Black-Scholes model with deterministic jumps at the dividend dates. Any approximation for vanilla basket option prices can also be applied on this problem, and the sophisticated Curran geometric conditioning was found to be particularly competitive in The Pricing of Vanilla Options with Cash Dividends as a Classic Vanilla Basket Option Problem.</description>

      <title>Easy Mistake With the Log-Euler Discretization On Black-Scholes</title>
      <link>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/logeuler_not_exact/</link>

      <guid>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/logeuler_not_exact/</guid>
      <description>In the Black-Scholes model with a term-structure of volatilities, the Log-Euler Monte-Carlo scheme is not necessarily exact.
This happens if you have two assets \(S_1\) and \(S_2\), with two different time varying volatilities \(\sigma_1(t), \sigma_2(t) \). The covariance from the Ito isometry from \(t=t_0\) to \(t=t_1\) reads $$ \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \sigma_1(s)\sigma_2(s) \rho ds, $$ while a naive log-Euler discretization may use $$ \rho \bar\sigma_1(t_0) \bar\sigma_2(t_0) (t_1-t_0). $$ In practice, the \( \bar\sigma_i(t_0) \) are calibrated such that the vanilla option prices are exact, meaning $$ \bar{\sigma}_i^2(t_0)(t_1-t_0) = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \sigma_i^2(s) ds.</description>

      <title>Roughness of Pure Jumps</title>

      <description>In my previous blog post, I looked at the roughness of the SVCJ stochastic volatility model with jumps (in the volatility). In this model, the jumps occur randomly, but at discrete times. And with typical parameters used in the litterature, the jumps are not so frequent. It is thus more interesting to look at the roughness of pure jump processes, such as the CGMY process.
The CGMY process is more challenging to simulate.</description>

      <description>I was wondering if adding jumps to stochastic volatility, as is done in the SVCJ model of Duffie, Singleton and Pan &amp;ldquo;Transform Analysis and Asset Pricing for Affine Jump-Diffusion&amp;rdquo; also in Broadie and Kaya &amp;ldquo;Exact simulation of stochastic volatility and other affine jump diffusion processes&amp;rdquo;, would lead to rougher paths, or if it would mislead the roughness estimators.
The answer to the first question can almost be answered visually: The parameters used are the one from Broadie and Kaya: v0=0.</description>

      <description>I received a few e-mails asking me for the code I used to measure roughness in my preprint on the roughness of the implied volatility. Unfortunately, the code I wrote for this paper is not in a good state, it&amp;rsquo;s all in one long file line by line, not necessarily in order of execution, with comments that are only meaningful to myself.
In this post I will present the code relevant to measuring the oxford man institute roughness with Julia.</description>

      <description>I was experimenting with the recent SABR basket approximation of Hagan. The approximation only works for the normal SABR model, meaning beta=0 in SABR combined with the Bachelier option formula.
I was wondering how good the approximation would be for two flat smiles (in terms of Black volatilities). I then noticed something that escaped me before: the normal SABR model is able to fit the pure Black model (with constant vols) extremely well.</description>

      <description>The Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature is known to be competitive with Gauss quadratures. It has several advantages:
the weights are easy and fast to compute. adaptive / doubling quadratures are possible with when the Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind is used for the quadrature. the Chebyshev nodes may also be used to interpolate some costly function. The wikipedia article has a relatively detailed description on how to compute the quadrature weights corresponding to the Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind (where the points -1 and 1 are included), via a type-I DCT.</description>

      <description>During my vacation, I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I looked at some stability issue with ghost points and the explicit method. I was initially trying out ghost points with the explicit runge kutta Chebyshev/Legendre/Gegenbauer technique and noticed some explosion in some cases.
I cornered it down to a stability issue of the standard explicit Euler method with ghost (or fictitious) points. The technique is described in the book &amp;ldquo;Paul Wilmott on Quantitative Finance&amp;rdquo; (also in Paul Wilmott introduces quantitative finance), which I find quite good, although I have some friends who are not much fond of it.</description>

      <description>The paper The Moment Formula for Implied Volatility at Extreme Strikes by Roger Lee redefined how practioners extrapolate the implied volatility, by showing that the total implied variance can be at most linear in the wings, with a slope below 2.
Shortly after, the SVI model of Jim Gatheral, with its linear wings, started to become popular.
In a recent paper in collaboration with Winfried Koller, we show that the asymptotic bounds are usually overly optimistic.</description>

      <description>In a Wilmott article from 2018 (Wilmott magazine no. 97) titled &amp;ldquo;Arbitrage in the perfect volatility surface&amp;rdquo;, Uwe Wystup points out some interesting issues on seemingly innocuous FX volatility surfaces:
a cubic spline tends to produce artificial peaks/modes in the density. SVI not arbitrage-free even on seemingly trivial input. The examples provided are indeed great and the remarks very valid. There is more to it however:
a cubic spline on strikes or log-moneyness does not produce the artificial peak.</description>

      <description>I recently presented my latest published paper On the Bachelier implied volatility at extreme strikes at the Princeton Fintech and Quant conference. The presenters were of quite various backgrounds. The first presentations were much more business oriented with lots of AI keywords, but relatively little technical content while the last presentation was about parallel programming. Many were a pitch to recruit to employees.
The diversity was interesting: it was refreshing to hear about quantitative finance from vastly different perspectives.</description>

      <description>I have been a long time user of Fedora at work and have been happy quite happy about it. Around 6 months ago, I moved to Manjaro under VirtualBox in a Windows host, because the company imposes the use of a VPN client that does not run on Linux. It&amp;rsquo;s much less great for several reasons:
VirtualBox makes everything graphics much slower. It is still way better than WSL2 as I found WSL2 to be a poor man&amp;rsquo;s Linux, where graphics is via some half broken X11 client for Windows.</description>

      <description>This is a follow up of my previous post on rough volatility. I recently tried to reproduce the results of the paper Rough Volatility: Fact or Artefact? as I was curious to apply the technique using different inputs. The 5-minutes SPX realized volatility is freely available in CSV format at the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance and it is thus relatively straightforward to reproduce the numbers presented in the paper.</description>

      <title>Volatility: Rough or Not? A Short Review</title>
      <link>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/rough-volatility-or-not-a-review/</link>

      <description>It is well-known that the assumption of constant volatility in the Black-Scholes model for pricing financial contracts is wrong and may lead to serious mispricing, especially for any exotic derivative contracts. A classic approach is to use a deterministic local volatility model to take into account the variation both in the time dimension and in the underlying asset price dimension. But the model is still not realistic in terms of forward smile (the implied volatilities of forward starting options).</description>

      <title>Monte-Carlo Parallelization: to vectorize or not?</title>

      <guid>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/monte-carlo-vectorization-or-not/</guid>
      <description>When writing a Monte-Carlo simulation to price financial derivative contracts, the most straightforward is to code a loop over the number of paths, in which each path is fully calculated. Inside the loop, a payoff function takes this path to compute the present value of the contract on the given path. The present values are recorded to lead to the Monte-Carlo statistics (mean, standard deviation). I ignore here any eventual callability of the payoff which may still be addressed with some work-arounds in this setup.</description>

      <title>More Automatic Differentiation Awkwardness</title>

      <guid>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/more-automatic-differentiation-awkwardness/</guid>
      <description>This blog post from Jherek Healy presents some not so obvious behavior of automatic differentiation, when a function is decomposed into the product of two parts where one part goes to infinity and the other to zero, and we know the overall result must go to zero (or to some other specific number). This decomposition may be relatively simple to handle for the value of the function, but becomes far less trivial to think of in advance, at the derivative level.</description>

      <description>In the context of my thesis, I explored the use of stochastic collocation to capture the marginal densities of a positive asset. Indeed, most financial asset prices must be non-negative. But the classic stochastic collocation towards the normally distributed random variable, is not.
A simple tweak, proposed early on by Grzelak, is to assume absorption and use the put-call parity to price put options (which otherwise depend on the left tail).</description>

      <description>Steven Koonin, who was Secretary for Science, Department of Energy, in the Obama administration recently wrote a somewhat controversial book on climate science with the title Unsettled. I was curious to read what kind of critics a physicist who partly worked in the field had, even if I believe that climate warming is real, and humans have an influence on it. It turns out that some of his remarks regarding models are relevant way beyond climate science, but some other subjects are not as convincing.</description>

The setup on Linux is not very complicated, and relatively well documented on Github itself but all the steps are not listed in a simplistic manner, and some Google search is still required to find out how to setup multiple private keys for various different servers or different repos.</description>

A mild example relates to the data from Israel about the delta variant. This kind of article, with the title &amp;ldquo;Covid 19 Case Data in Israel, a Troubling Trend&amp;rdquo;, puts emphasis on the doubts on the effectivness of the vaccine:
the vaccine appears to have a negligible effect on an individual as to whether he/she catches the current strain.</description>

      <description>This is the story of their hack.
Yesterday evening, I received a call from my mother, frantic over the phone. She says she sees alerts of withdrawals from her bank account on her phone, with new alerts every 5 minutes or so. I try to ask her if she clicked recently on some e-mail related to her bank. She is so panicked that I don&amp;rsquo;t manage to have an answer. While trying to understand if those alerts are real or not, my wife suggests immediately that my mother should call her bank.</description>

      <description>I stumbled upon a new short book Financial Models in Production from O. Kettani and A. Reghai. A page attracted my attention
A page from Kettani and Reghai&amp;#39;s book. This is the same example as I used on my blog, where I also present the Li&amp;rsquo;s SOR method combined with the good initial guess from Stefanica. The idea has also been expanded on in Jherek Healy&amp;rsquo;s book. What is shocking is that, beside reusing my example, they reuse my timing for Jäckel and my implementation is in Google Go, with a timing done on some older laptop.</description>

      <description>I was wondering what were exactly the eigenvalues of the Mersenne-Twister random number generator transition matrix. An article by K. Savvidy sparked my interest on this. This article mentioned a poor entropy (sum of log of eigenvalues amplitudes which are greater than 1), with eigenvalues falling almost on the unit circle.
The eigenvalues are also the roots of the characteristic polynomial. It turns out, that for jumping ahead in the random number sequence, we use the characteristic polynomial.</description>

      <description>Several years ago, I read the book No Logo from Naomi Klein. I did not find it particularly good, but it did raise a valid concern overall. This summer I read Shock Therapy - The rise of disaster capitalism. It suffers from some of the same flaws as No Logo, namely a lot of repetition of the same idea. Here, the underlying idea is that neoliberalism does not work in practice, and often ends up being some kind of corporatism.</description>

      <description>My previous post described the recent view on random number generators, with a focus on the Mersenne-Twister war.
Since, I have noticed another front in the war of the random number generators:
An example in dimension 121 from K Savvidy where L&amp;rsquo;Ecuyer MRG32k3a fails to compute the correct result, regardless of the seed. This is a manufactured example, such that the vector, used in the example, falls in the dual lattice of the generator.</description>

      <description>These days, there seems to be some sort of small war to define what is a modern good random number generators to advise for simulations. Historically, the Mersenne-Twister (MT thereafter) won this war. It is used by default in many scientific libraries and software, even if there has been a few issues with it:
A bad initial seed may make it generate a sequence of low quality for at least as many as 700K numbers.</description>

      <description>A while ago, I wondered how to make some implementation of Sobol support 64-bits integers (long) and double floating points. Sobol is the most used quasi random number generator (QRNG) for (quasi) Monte-Carlo simulations.
The standard Sobol algorithms are all coded with 32-bits integers and lead to double floating point numbers which can not be smaller than \( 2^{-31} \). I was recently looking back at the internals at Sobol generators, and noticed that generating with 64-bits integers would not help much.</description>

      <description>What has been happening to the INTC stock today may be revealing of the future. The stock dropped more than 16%, mainly because they announced that their 7nm process does not work (well) and they may rely on an external foundry for their processors. Initially, in 2015, they thought they would have 8nm process by 2017, and 7nm by 2018. They are more than 3 years late.
Intel used to be a leader in the manufacturing process for microprocessor.</description>

      <description>The stock market crashed by more than 7% on March 9, 2020. It is one of the most important drop since September 2001. I looked at BNP warrant prices on the CAC40 French index, with a maturity of March 20, 2020 , to see what they would tell about the market direction on the day of the crash. This is really a not-so-scientific experiment.
The quotes I got were quite noisy.</description>

      <description>Today my 6-years old son came with a math homework. The stated goal was to learn the different ways to make 10 out of smaller numbers. I was impressed. Immediately, I wondered
how many ways are there to make 10 out of smaller numbers?
This is one of the beauties of maths: a very simple problem, which a 6-years old can understand, may actually be quite fundamental. If you want to solve this in the general case, for any number instead of 10, you end up with the partition function.</description>

      <description>Many benchmarks show impressive performance gains with the use of Numba or Pypy. Numba allows to compile just-in-time some specific methods, while Pypy takes the approach of compiling/optimizing the full python program: you use it just like the standard python runtime. From those benchmarks, I imagined that those tools would improve my 2D Heston PDE solver performance easily. The initialization part of my program contains embedded for loops over several 10Ks elements.</description>

      <description>Out of curiosity, I tried quadprog as open-source quadratic programming convex optimizer, as it is looks fast, and the code stays relatively simple. I however stumbled on cases where the algorithm would return NaNs even though my inputs seemed straighforward. Other libraries such as CVXOPT did not have any issues with those inputs.
Searching on the web, I found that I was not the only one to stumble on this kind of issue with quadprog.</description>

      <description>This is a follow up to my previous post where I explore the probability of a TSLA stock crash, reproducing the results of Timothy Klassen.
According to the implied cumulative probability density, TSLA has around 15% chance of crashing below $100. Is this really high compared to other stocks? or is it the interpretation of the data erroneous?
Here I take a look at NFLX (Netflix). Below is the implied volatility according to three different models.</description>

      <description>Timothy Klassen had an interesting post on linkedin recently, with the title &amp;ldquo;the options market thinks there is a 16% chance that Tesla will not exist in January 2020&amp;rdquo;. As I was also recently looking at the TSLA options, I was a bit intrigued. I looked at the option chain on July 10th, and implied the European volatility from the American option prices. I then fit a few of my favorite models: Andreasen-Huge with Tikhonov regularization, the lognormal mixture, and a polynomial collocation of degree 7.</description>

      <description>I was wondering if I could use the SABR moments to calibrate a model to SABR parameters directly. It turns out that the SABR moments have relatively simple expressions when \(\beta=0\), that is, for the normal SABR model (with no absorption). This is for the pure SABR stochatic volatility model, not the Hagan approximation. For the Hagan approximation, we would need to use the replication by vanilla options to compute the moments.</description>

      <description>This is a follow-up to my posts on the implied risk-neutral density (RND) of the SPW options before and after the big volatility change that happened in early February with two different techniques: a smoothing spline on the implied volatilities and a Gaussian kernel approach.
The Gaussian kernel (as well as to some extent the smoothing spline) let us believe that there are multiple modes in the distribution (multiple peaks in the density).</description>

      <description>It has been a while since the good old object-oriented (OO) programming is not trendy anymore. Functional programming or more dynamic programming (Python-based) have been the trend, with an excursion in template based programming for C++ guys. Those are not strict categories: Python can be used in a very OO way, but it&amp;rsquo;s not how it is marketed or considered by the community.
Recently, I have seen some of the ugliest refactoring in my life as a programmer, done by someone with at least 10 years of experience programming in Java.</description>

      <description>In the previous post, I showed a plot of the probability implied from SPW options before and after the big volatility change of last week. I created it from a least squares spline fit of the market mid implied volatilities (weighted by the inverse of the bid-ask spread). While it looks reasonable, the underlying technique is not very robust. It is particularly sensitive to the number of options strikes used as spline nodes.</description>

      <description>Yesterday the American stocks went a bit crazy along with the VIX that jumped from 17.50 to 38. It&amp;rsquo;s not exactly clear why, the news mention that the Fed might raise its interest rates, the bonds yield have been recently increasing substantially, and the market self-correcting after stocks grew steadily for months in a low VIX environment.
I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly follow the SPX/SPW options daily. But I had taken a snapshot two weeks ago when the market was quiet.</description>

      <description>Several months ago, I had a quick look at a recent paper describing how to use Wavelets to price options under stochastic volatility models with a known characteristic function. The more classic method is to use some numerical quadrature directly on the Fourier integral as described in this paper for example. When I read the paper, I was skeptical about the Wavelet approach, since it looked complicated, and with many additional parameters.</description>

Who needs decentralization for a small team or a small company working together? ‎SVN is proven, works well and is simple to use and put in place. Each argument is in reality not so strong.</description>

      <description>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are the current hype (again). In their new Ryzen processors, AMD advertises the Neural Net Prediction. It turns out this is was already used in their older (2012) Piledriver architecture used for example in the AMD A10-4600M. It is also present in recent Samsung processors such as the one powering the Galaxy S7. What is it really?
The basic idea can be traced to a paper from Daniel Jimenez and Calvin Lin &amp;ldquo;Dynamic Branch Prediction with Perceptrons&amp;rdquo;, more precisely described in the subsequent paper &amp;ldquo;Neural methods for dynamic branch prediction&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Unfortunately, in their main formula for non-negativity, they made a typo: the equation (3.3) is not consistent with the equation (3.1): the \( \Delta x_{i-1/2} \) is interverted with \( \Delta x_{i+1/2} \).
It was not obvious to find out which equation was wrong since there is no proof in the paper.</description>

      <description>Dan Stefanica and Rados Radoicic propose a quite good initial guess in their very recent paper An Explicit Implied Volatility Formula. Their formula is simple, fast to compute and results in an implied volatility guess with a relative error of less than 10%.
It is more robust than the rational fraction from Minquiang Li: his rational fraction is only valid for a fixed range of strikes and maturities. The new approximation is mathematically proved accurate across all strikes and all maturities.</description>

      <description>The VIX implied volatilities used to look like a logarithmic function of the strikes. I don&amp;rsquo;t look at them often, but today, I noticed that the VIX had the start of a smile shape.
1m VIX implied volatilities on March 21, 2017 with strictly positive volume. Very few strikes trades below the VIX future level (12.9). All of this is likely because the VIX is unusually low: not many people are looking to trade it much lower.</description>

      <description>In order to fit the implied volatility smile of equity options, one of the most popular parameterization is Jim Gatheral&amp;rsquo;s SVI, which I have written about before here.
It turns out that in the current market conditions, SVI does not work well for short maturities. SPX options expiring on March 24, 2017 (one week) offer a good example. I paid attention to include only options with non zero volume, that is options that are actually traded.</description>

download tar.gz linux driver from Samsung website. As root, unpack &amp;amp; install: tar xvzf SamsungPrinterInstaller.tar.gz cd uld ./install.sh in the printer menu, lookup for the wireless key (8 digits), connect to the printer Wifi network with a computer using the wireless key, enter the network gateway IP, this is typically http://192.</description>

      <description>A couple weeks ago, I wrote about a new Heston discretisation scheme which was at least as accurate as Andersen QE scheme and faster, called DVSS2.
It turns out that it does not behave very well on the following Vanilla forward start option example (which is quite benign). The Heston parameters comes from a calibration to the market and are
$$v_0= 0.0718, \kappa= 1.542, \theta= 0.0762, \sigma= 0.582, \rho= -0.352$$</description>

      <description>The gnome shell has been crashing on me more regularly lately. XFCE is a good and fast more tradional desktop, but, from past experiences, it does not play well with power management if you only install it via
dnf install @xfce-desktop-environment My typical experience is a black screen after resuming from suspend (sometimes, not always), or hibernate (always) and most of the time I end up just rebooting. It turns out this is all caused by the interaction between the gdm login daemon and xfce.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between floating-strike and fixed-strike Asian options</title>

      <description>Many papers present formulae to price Asian options in the Black-Scholes world only for the fixed strike Asian case, that is a contract that pays \( \max(A-K,0)\) at maturity \(T\) where \(A = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w_i S(t_i) \) is the Asian average.
More generally, this can be seen as the payoff of a Basket option where the underlyings are just the same asset but at different times. And any Basket option formula can actually be used to price fixed-strike Asian options by letting the correlation correspond to the correlation between the asset at the averaging times and the variances correspond to the variance at each averaging time.</description>

      <description>It is relatively well known that the Black-Scholes volatility can not grow faster than \(\sqrt{\ln(K)}\). The rule is also sometimes simply stated as &amp;ldquo;the implied variance can not grow faster than linear&amp;rdquo; (in log-moneyness). The proof comes from Roger Lee &amp;ldquo;The moment formula for implied volatility at extreme strikes&amp;rdquo; but the rule was suggested earlier, for example in Hodge&amp;rsquo;s paper from 1996 &amp;ldquo;Arbitrage bounds of the implied volatility strike and term structures of European-style options&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I stumbled recently upon a new Heston discretisation scheme, in the spirit of Alfonsi, not more complex and more accurate.
My first attempt at coding the scheme resulted in a miserable failure even though the described algorithm looked not too difficult. I started wondering if the paper, from a little known Lithuanian mathematical journal, was any good. Still, the math in it is very well written, with a great emphasis on the settings for each proposition.</description>

      <description>Jesper Andreasen and Brian Huge propose an arbitrage-free interpolation method based on a single-step forward Dupire PDE solution in their paper Volatility interpolation. To do so, they consider a piecewise constant representation of the local volatility in maturity time and strike where the number of constants matches the number of market option prices.
An interesting example that shows some limits to the technique as described in Jesper Andreasen and Brian Huge paper comes from Nabil Kahale paper on an arbitrage-free interpolation of volatilities.</description>

      <description>We will assume zero interest rates and no dividends on the asset \(S\) for clarity. The results can be easily generalized to the case with non-zero interest rates and dividends. Under those assumptions, the Black-Scholes PDE is: $$	\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} = 0.$$
An implicit Euler discretisation on a uniform grid in \(S\) of width \(h\) with linear boundary conditions (zero Gamma) leads to:</description>

      <description>We have seen earlier that a simple parabola allows to capture the smile of AAPL 1m options surprisingly well. For very high and very low strikes, the parabola does not obey Lee&amp;rsquo;s moments formula (the behavior in the wings needs to be at most linear in variance/log-moneyness).
Extrapolating the volatility smile in the low or high strikes in a smooth \(C^2\) fashion is however not easy. A surprisingly popular so called &amp;ldquo;arbitrage-free&amp;rdquo; method is the extrapolation of Benaim, Dodgson and Kainth developed to remedy the negative density of SABR in interest rates as well as to give more control over the wings.</description>

So many journalists have written around Piketty, that I had to buy the book and read it. It turns out that some of the criticism I have read is not really founded once one reads the book, but here are other real obvious criticisms that I suprisingly did not hear.</description>

Beside the relatively large gap between academia and the industry, which this workshop was trying to address, one thing that struck me is how difficult it was for people of slightly different specialties to communicate.
It seemed that mathematicians of different countries working on different subjects related to backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) would not truly understand each other.</description>

      <description>In my previous post, I looked at de-arbitraging volatilities of options of a specific maturity with the shooting method. In reality it is not so practical. While the local volatility will be continuous at the given expiry \(T\), it won&amp;rsquo;t be so at the times \( t \lt T \) because of the interpolation or extrapolation in time. If we consider a single market expiry at time \(T\), it is standard practice to extrapolate the implied volatility flatly for \(t \lt T\), that is, \(w(y,t) = v_T(y) t\) where the variance at time \(T\) is defined as \(v_T(y)= \frac{1}{T}w(y,T)\).</description>

      <description>In my previous post, I looked at de-arbitraging volatilities of options of a specific maturity with SVI (re-)calibration. The penalty method can be used beyond SVI. For example I interpolate here with a cubic spline on 11 equidistant nodes the original volatility slice that contains arbitrages and then minimize with Levenberg-Marquardt and the negative local variance denominator penalty on 51 equidistant points. This results in a quite small adjustment to the original volatilities:</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I wrote about some calendar spread arbitrages with SVI. Today I am looking at the famous example of butterfly spread arbitrage from Axel Vogt. $$(a, b, m, \rho, \sigma) = (−0.0410, 0.1331, 0.3586, 0.3060, 0.4153)$$ The parameters obey the weak no-arbitrage constraint of Gatheral, and yet produce a negative density, or equivalently, a negative denominator in the local variance Dupire formula. Those parameters are mentioned in Jim Gatheral and Antoine Jacquier paper on arbitrage free SVI volatility surfaces and also in Damghani&amp;rsquo;s paper dearbitraging a weak smile.</description>

This is not too surprising if you look at the parameters, they vary wildly between the first and the second expiry.

      <description>I had a look at how to price under Local Volatility with Cash dividends in my previous post. I still had a somewhat large error in my FDM price. After too much time, I managed to find the culprit, it was the extrapolation of the prices when applying the jump continuity condition \(V(S,t_\alpha^-) = V(S-\alpha, t_\alpha^+) \) for an asset \(S\) with a cash dividend of amount \(\alpha\) at \( t_\alpha \).</description>

      <description>The Dupire equation for local volatility has been derived under the assumption of Martingality, that means no dividends or interest rates. The extension to continuous dividend yield is described in many papers or books:
With cash dividends however, the Black-Scholes formula is not valid anymore if we suppose that the asset jumps at the dividend date of the dividend amount. There are various relatively accurate approximations available to price an option supposing a constant (spot) volatility and jumps, for example, this one.</description>

It turns out that the simple parabola has the lowest RMSE, and SVI is not really better than SABR on that example.
SVI, SABR, least squares parabola fitted to AAPL 1m options Note that this is just one single example, unlikely to be representative of anything, but I thought this was interesting that in practice, a simple parabola can compare favorably to more complex models.</description>

      <description>A while ago, I have applied a relatively simple adaptive Filon quadrature to the problem of volatility swap pricing. The Filon quadrature is an old quadrature from 1928 that allows to integrate oscillatory integrand like \(f(x)\cos(k x) \) or \(f(x)\sin(k x) \). It turns out that combined with an adaptive Simpson like method, it has many advantages over more generic adaptive quadrature methods like Gauss-Lobatto, which is often used on similar problems.</description>

      <description>When the dividend curve is built from discrete cash dividends, the dividend yield is discontinuous at the dividend time as the asset price jumps from the dividend amount. This can be particularly problematic for numerical schemes like finite difference methods. In deed, a finite difference grid will make use of the forward yield (eventually adjusted to the discretisation scheme), which explodes then. Typically, if one is not careful about this, then increasing the number of time steps does not increase accuracy anymore, as the spike just becomes bigger on a smaller time interval.</description>

      <description>I moved my blog from blogger to Hugo. Blogger really did not evolve since Google take-over in 2003. Wordpress is today much nicer and prettier. It&amp;rsquo;s clear that Google did not invest at all, possibly because blogs are passé. Compared to mid 2000, there are very few blogs today. Even programming blogs are scarce. It could be interesting to quantify this. My theory is that it is the direct consequence of the popularity of social networks, and especially facebook (possibly also stackoverflow for programmers): people don&amp;rsquo;t have time anymore to write as their extra-time is used on social networks.</description>

      <description>On the Wilmott forum, Pat Hagan has recently suggested to cap the equivalent local volatility in order to control the wings and better match CMS prices. It also helps making the SABR approximation better behaved as the expansion is only valid when
$$ 1 + 2\frac{\rho\nu}{\alpha}y(K)+\frac{\nu^2}{\alpha^2}y^2(K) $$is close to 1.&amp;nbsp;
In the PDE approach (especially the non transformed one), it is very simple, one just needs to update the equivalent local vol as&amp;nbsp;$$\alpha K^\beta \min\left(M, \sqrt{1 + 2\frac{\rho\nu}{\alpha}y(K)+\frac{\nu^2}{\alpha^2}y^2(K)}\right)$$</description>

      <description>I am ambivalent towards David Foster Wallace. He can write the most creative sentences and make innocuous subjects very interesting. At the same time, i never finished his bookInfinite Jest, partly because the characters names are too awkward for me so that i never exactly remember who is who, but also because the story itself is a bit too crazy.
I knew however that a non fiction book on the subject of infinity written by him would make for a very interesting read.</description>

      <description>I just stumbled upon this particularly illustrative case where the Crank-Nicolson finite difference scheme behaves badly, and the Rannacher smoothing (2-steps backward Euler) is less than ideal: double one touch and double no touch options.
It is particularly evident when the option is sure to be hit, for example when the barriers are narrow, that is our delta should be around zero as well as our gamma. Let&#39;s consider a double one touch option with spot=100, upBarrier=101, downBarrier=99.</description>

      <description>I was wondering how to generate some nice cloudy like texture with a simple program. I first thought about using the Brownian motion, but of course if one uses it raw, with one pixel representing one movement in time, it&#39;s just going to look like a very noisy and grainy picture like this:
Normal noise
There is however a nice continuous representation of the Brownian motion : the Paley-Wiener representation</description>

      <description>I have looked a few months ago already at Julia, Dart, Rust and Scala programming languages to see how practical they could be for a simple Monte-Carlo option pricing.
I forgot the Go language. I had tried it 1 or 2 years ago, and at that time, did not enjoy it too much. Looking at Go 1.5 benchmarks on the computer language shootout, I was surprised that it seemed so close to Java performance now, while having a GC that guarantees pauses of less 10ms and consuming much less memory.</description>

      <description>In his book &#34;Monte Carlo Methods in Finance&#34;, P. Jäckel explains a simple way to clean up a correlation matrix. When a given correlation matrix is not positive semi-definite, the idea is to do a singular value decomposition (SVD), replace the negative eigenvalues by 0, and renormalize the corresponding eigenvector accordingly.
One of the cited applications is &#34;stress testing and scenario analysis for market risk&#34; or &#34;comparative pricing in order to ascertain the extent of correlation exposure for multi-asset derivatives&#34;</description>

      <description>There are not many arbitrage free extrapolation schemes. Benaim et al. extrapolation is one of the few that claims it. However, despite the paper&amp;rsquo;s title, it is not truely arbitrage free. The density might be positive, but the forward is not preserved by the implied density. It can also lead to wings that don&amp;rsquo;t obey Lee&amp;rsquo;s moments condition.
On a Wilmott forum, P. Caspers proposed the following counter-example based on extrapolating SABR: \( \alpha=15%, \beta=80%, \nu=50%, \rho=-48%, f=3%, T=20.</description>

      <description>I am looking at various extrapolation schemes of the implied volatilities. An interesting one I stumbled upon is due to Kahale. Even if his paper is on interpolation, there is actually a small paragraph on using the same kind of function for extrapolation. His idea is to simply lookup the standard deviation \( \Sigma \) and the forward \(f\) corresponding to a given market volatility and slope: $$ c_{f,\Sigma} = f N(d_1) - k N(d_2)$$ with $$ d_1 = \frac{\log(f/k)+\Sigma^2 /2}{\Sigma} $$</description>

sometimes (rarely) my laptop would not wake up from sleep. notifications sometimes keep popping up too much. on my desktop, experienced strong tearing issues with the Radeon graphic card, except with some very specific combination of video player settings and desktop settings (and then I had annoying redraw issue when pushing volume up/down in movies).</description>

      <description>C. Reisinger kindly pointed out to me this paper around square root Crank-Nicolson. The idea is to apply a square root of time transformation to the PDE, and discretize the resulting PDE with Crank-Nicolson. Two reasons come to mind to try this: the square root transform will result in small steps initially, where the solution is potentially not so smooth, making Crank-Nicolson behave better.&amp;nbsp;it is the natural time of the Brownian motion.</description>

      <description>Here are the main steps of Hagan derivation. Let&#39;s recall his notation for the SABR model where typically, \\(C(F) = F^\beta\\) First, he defines the moments of stochastic volatility: Then he integrates the Fokker-Planck equation over all A, to obtain On the backward Komolgorov equation, he applies a Lamperti transform like change of variable: And then makes another change of variable so that the PDE has the same initial conditions for all moments: &amp;nbsp;This leads to It turns out that there is a magical symmetry for k=0 and k=2.</description>

      <description>I looked nearly two years ago already at the arbitrage free SABR of Andreasen-Huge in comparison to the arbitrage free PDE of Hagan and showed how close the ideas were: Andreasen-Huge relies on the normal Dupire forward PDE using a slightly simpler local vol (no time dependent exponential term) while Hagan works directly on the Fokker-Planck PDE (you can think of it as the Dupire Forward PDE for the density) and uses an expansion of same order as the original SABR formula (which leads to an additional exponential term in the local volatility).</description>

      <description>A few recent programming languages sparked my interest:
Julia because of the wide coverage of mathematical functions, and great attention to quality of the implementations. It has also some interesting web interface. Dart: because it&amp;rsquo;s a language focused purely on building apps for the web, and has a supposedly good VM. Rust: it&amp;rsquo;s the latest fad. It has interesting concepts around concurrency and a focus on being low level all the while being simpler than C.</description>

      <description>I have looked at jump effects on volatility vs. variance swaps. There is a similar behavior on tail events, that is, on truncating the replication. One main problem with discrete replication of variance swaps is the implicit domain truncation, mainly because the variance swap equivalent log payoff is far from being linear in the wings. The equivalent payoff with Carr-Lee for a volatility swap is much more linear in the wings (not so far of a straddle).</description>

      <description>Antonov et al. present an interesting view on SABR with negative rates: instead of relying on a shifted SABR to allow negative rates up to a somewhat arbitrary shift, they modify slightly the SABR model to allow negative rates directly: $$ dF_t = |F_t|^\beta v_t dW_F $$ with \\( v\_t \\) being the standard lognormal volatility process of SABR.
Furthermore they derive a clever semi-analytical approximation for this model, based on low correlation, quite close to the Monte-Carlo prices in their tests.</description>

      <description>There is very little information on variance swaps on a foreign asset. There can be two kinds of contracts:
one that pays the foreign variance in a domestic currency, this is a quanto contract as the exchange rate is implicitly fixed.one that pays the foreign variance, multiplied by the fx rate at maturity. This is a flexo contract, and is just about buying a variance swap from a foreign bank.</description>

      <guid>https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/jumps-impact-variance-swap-vs-volatility-swap/</guid>
      <description>Beside the problem with the discreteness of the replication, variance swaps are sensitive to jumps. This is an often mentioned reason for the collapse of the single name variance swap market in 2008 as jumps are more likely on single name equities.
Those graphs are the result of Monte-Carlo simulations with various jump sizes using the Bates model, and using Local Volatility implied from the Bates vanilla prices. The local volatility price will be the same price as per static replication for the variance swap, and we can see it they converge when there is no jump.</description>

      <description>People regularly believe that Variance swaps need to be priced by discrete replication, because the market trades only a discrete set of options.
In reality, a discrete replication will misrepresent the tail, and can be quite arbitrary. It looks like the discrete replication as described in Derman Goldman Sachs paper is in everybody&#39;s mind, probably because it&#39;s easy to grasp. Strangely, it looks like most forget the section &#34;Practical problems with replication&#34;</description>

      <description>In an earlier post, I mentioned the similarities between the Guyon-Labordere particle method and the Vanderstoep-Grzelak-Oosterlee &amp;ldquo;bin&amp;rdquo; method to calibrate and price under Local Stochastic volatility. I will be a bit more precise here. The same thing, really
The particle method can be seen as a generalization of the &amp;ldquo;bin&amp;rdquo; method. In deed, the bin method consists in doing the particle method using a histogram estimation of the conditional variance. The histogram estimation can be more or less seen as a very basic rectangle kernel with the appropriate bandwidth.</description>

      <description>In papers around volatility and cash (discrete) dividends, we often encounter the example of the flat volatility surface. For example, the OpenGamma paper presents this graph:
It shows that if the Black volatility surface is fully flat, there are jumps in the pure volatility surface (corresponding to a process that includes discrete dividends in a consistent manner) at the dividend dates or equivalently if the pure volatility surface is flat, the Black volatility jumps.</description>

I was struck by the fact that most techniques and ideas apply also to problems in quantitative finance.
Linear regression: used for example in the Longstaff-Schwartz approach to price Bermudan options with Monte-Carlo. Interestingly the teacher insists on feature normalization, something we can forget easily, especially with the polynomial features.</description>

      <description>Quasi-Random numbers (like Sobol) are a relatively popular way in finance to improve the Monte-Carlo convergence compared to more classic Pseudo-Random numbers (like Mersenne-Twister). Behind the scenes one has to be a bit more careful about the dimension of the problem as the Quasi-Random numbers depends on the dimension (defined by how many random variables are independent from each other).
For a long time, Sobol was limited to 40 dimensions using the so called Bratley-Fox direction numbers (his paper actually gives the numbers for 50 dimensions).</description>

      <description>Recently, some instabilities were noticed in the Carr-Lee seasoned volatility swap price in some situations. The Carr-Lee seasoned volatility swap price involve the computation of a double integral. The inner integral is really the problematic one as the integrand can be highly oscillating.
I&amp;nbsp; first found a somewhat stable behavior using a specific adaptive Gauss-Lobatto implementation (the one from Espelid) and a change of variable. But it was not very satisfying to see that the outer integral was stable only with another specific adaptive Gauss-Lobatto (the one from Gander &amp;amp; Gauschi, present in Quantlib).</description>

Pat Hagan used that transformation for a better discretization of the arbitrage free SABR PDE model.I then started to notice the use of this transformation in many more papers. The first one I saw naming it &amp;ldquo;Lamperti transform&amp;rdquo; was the paper from Ait-Sahalia Maximum likelyhood estimation of discretely sampled diffusions: a closed-form approximation approach.</description>

      <description>I stumbled upon an unexpected problem: the one touch barrier formula can break down under negative rates. While negative rates can sound fancy, they are actually quite real on some markets. Combined with relatively low volatilities, this makes the standard Black-Scholes one touch barrier formula blow up because somewhere the square root of a negative number is taken.
At first, I had the idea to just floor the number to 0.</description>

      <description>I have been looking at various ways of finding initial guesses for SVI calibration (Another SVI Initial Guess, More SVI Initial Guesses, SVI and long maturities issues). I decided to write a paper summarizing this. I find that the process of writing a paper makes me think more carefully about a problem.
In this case, it turns out that the Vogt initial guess method (guess via asymptotes and minimum variance) is actually very good as long as one has a good way to lookup the asymptotes (the data is not always convex, while SVI is) and as long as rho is not close to -1, that is for long maturity affine like smiles, where SVI is actually more difficult to calibrate properly due to the over-parameterisation in those cases.</description>

      <description>The variance under SVI becomes linear when the log-moneyness is very large in absolute terms. The lognormal SABR formula with beta=0 or beta=1 has a very different behavior. Of course, the theoretical SABR model has actually a different asymptotic behavior.
As an illustration, we calibrate SABR (with two different values of beta) and SVI against the same implied volatility slice and look at the wings behavior. While the Lee moments formula implies that the variance should be at most linear, something that the SABR formula does not respect.</description>

      <description>On long maturities equity options, the smile is usually very much like a skew: very little curvature. This usually means that the SVI rho will be very close to -1, in a similar fashion as what can happen for the the correlation parameter of a real stochastic volatility model (Heston, SABR).
In terms of initial guess, I looked at the more usual use cases and showed that matching a parabola at the minimum variance point often leads to a decent initial guess if one has an ok estimate of the wings.</description>

      <description>In the previous post, I showed one could extract the SVI parameters from a best fit parabola at-the-money. It seemed to work reasonably well, but I found some real market data where it can be much less satisfying.
Sometimes (actually not so rarely) the ATM slope and curvatures can&#39;t be matched given rho and b found through the asymptotes. As a result if I force to just match the curvature and set m=0 (when the slope can&#39;t be matched), the simple ATM parabolic guess looks shifted.</description>

      <description>The SVI formula is:
$$w(k) = a + b ( \rho (k-m) + \sqrt{(k-m)^2+ \sigma^2}$$
where k is the log-moneyness, w(k) the implied variance at a given moneyness and a,b,rho,m,sigma the 5 SVI parameters.
A. Vogt described a particularly simple way to find an initial guess to fit SVI to an implied volatility slice a while ago. The idea to compute rho and sigma from the left and right asymptotic slopes.</description>

      <description>In a talk at the Global Derivatives conference of Amsterdam (2014), Pat Hagan presented some new SABR formulas, supposedly close to the arbitrage free PDE behavior.
I tried to code those from the slides, but somehow that did not work out well on his example, I just had something very close to the good old SABR formulas. I am not 100% sure (only 99%) that it is due to a mistake in my code.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s relatively well known that Heston does not fit the market for short expiries. Given that there are just 5 parameters to fit a full surface, it&#39;s almost logical that one part of the surface of it is not going to fit well the market.
I was more surprised to see how bad Heston or Schobel-Zhu were to fit a single short expiry volatility slice. As an example I looked at SP500 options with 1 week expiry.</description>

      <description>Most developers have strong opinions on dynamic types programming languages vs static types programming languages. The former is often assumed to be good for small projects/prototyping while the later better for bigger projects. But there is a surprisingly small number of studies to back those claims.
One such study is &#34;An experiment about static and dynamic type systems: doubts about the positive impact of static type systems on development time&#34;</description>

      <description>I have found a particularly nice initial guess to calibrate SABR. As it is quite close to the true best fit, it is tempting to use a very simple minimizer to go to the best fit. Levenberg-Marquardt works well on this problem, but can we shave off a few iterations?
I firstly considered the basic Newton&#39;s method, but for least squares minimization, the Hessian (second derivatives) is needed. It&#39;s possible to obtain it, even analytically with SABR, but it&#39;s quite annoying to derive it and code it without some automatic differentiation tool.</description>

Alternatively it can be asked with just an at-the-money european option under very high volatility.</description>

      <description>While I was playing around calibrating the arbitrage free SABR model from Hagan (using the PDE on probability density approach), I noticed a misbehavior for some short maturity smiles. I thought it was due to the PDE implementation. Actually some of it was, but the remaining large error was due to the bpvol solver.
I initially took the same approach as Choi et al. in my solver, that is to work with in-the-money prices (they work with straddles) because it&amp;rsquo;s nice and convenient.</description>

void myMethod() throws Exception
instead of
void myMethod() throws MyAPIException
void myMethod() throws MyAPIRuntimeException
void myMethod() where MyAPI represents either a generic API related exception or a specific exception related to the method in question.</description>

Similarly KDE 4 was a nightmare of instability and inflexibility when it came out.

It took me a bit of time to get used to it, and in the early stages I went to KDE 4 for a while, only to come back to it later.</description>

      <description>While playing around with differential evolution to calibrate SABR, I noticed that sometimes, several set of parameters can lead to a very similar smile, usually the good one is for relatively low vol of vol and the bad one is for relatively high vol of vol. I first looked for errors in my implementation, but it&amp;rsquo;s a real phenomenon. I used the normal implied volatility formula with beta=1, then converted it to lognormal (Black) volatility.</description>

      <description>Some people use Heston to fit one slice of a volatility surface. In this case, some parameters are clearly redundant. Still, I was wondering how it fared against SABR, which is always used to fit a slice. And what about Schobel-Zhu? Aggregated error in fit per slice on 10 surfaces With Heston, the calibration is actually slightly better with kappa=0, that is, without mean reversion, because the global optimization is easier and the mean reversion is fully redundant.</description>

      <description>Two months ago, I looked at arbitrage free interpolation using piecewise-constant density. This is equivalent to a piecewise quadratic polynomial in call prices where each piece is centered around each call strike.
I wondered at the time what a quadratic spline would look like on this problem, as it should be very close in theory, except that we can ensure that it is C1, a condition for a good looking implied volatility.</description>

      <description>I am currently reading the book &amp;ldquo;Nonlinear Option Pricing&amp;rdquo; by J. Guyon and P. Henry-Labordère. It&amp;rsquo;s quite interesting even if the first third is quite theoretical. For example they describe how to solve some not well defined non-linear parabolic PDE by relying on the parabolic envelope. They also explain why most problems lead to parabolic PDEs in finance.
The rest is a bit more practical. I stumbled upon an good remark regarding Longstaff-Schwartz: the algorithm as Longstaff and Schwarz describe it does not necessary lead to a low-biased estimate as they use future information (the paths they regress on) in the Monte-Carlo estimate.</description>

Out of a silly exercise, I decided to try my hand for a more accurate Normal (or basis point) volatility solver.
In reality, the problem is much simpler in the Bachelier/Normal model. A very basic analysis of Bachelier formula shows that the problem can be reduced to a single variable, as Choi et al explain in their paper.</description>

      <description>The calibration of a stochastic volatility model or a volatility surface parameterization (like SVI) involves minimizing the model options volatilities against market options volatilities. Often, the model computes an option price, not an implied volatility. It is therefore useful to have a fast way to invert that option price to get back the implied volatility that corresponds to it. Furthermore during the calibration procedure, the model option price can vary widely: it is convenient to have a robust implied volatility solver.</description>

I showed that interpolating in log prices instead of prices was enough to remove the wiggles, but then, it appears that the interpolation is not guaranteed to be arbitrage free, even though it often is. On another example from P. Jaeckel paper, that I reproduced inaccurately but well enough, it is not.</description>

      <description>I always wondered if Bachelier was really worse than Black-Scholes in practice. As an experiment I fit various implied volatility surfaces with Bachelier and Black-Scholes and look at the average error in implied volatility by slice.
In theory Bachelier is appealing because slightly simpler: log returns are a bit more challenging to think about than returns. And it also takes indirectly into account the fact that OTM calls are less likely than OTM puts because of default risk, if you assume absorbing probability at strike 0.</description>

      <description>Peter Jaeckel, in a recent paper (pdf), shows that something that sounds like a reasonable arbitrage free interpolation can produce wiggles in the implied volatility slice.
The interpolation in question is using some convexity preserving spline on call and put option prices directly and in strike, assuming those input prices are arbitrage free. This is very similar to Kahale interpolation (pdf).
It seemed too crazy for me so I had to try out his example.</description>

      <description>Several papers show that the limit for large strikes of Heston is SVI.
Interestingly, I stumbled onto a surface where the Hagan SABR fit was perfect as well as the SVI fit, while the Heston fit was not.
Originally, I knew that, on this data, the SVI fit was perfect. Until today, I just never tried to fit a lognormal SABR on the same data. I did a small test with random values of the SABR parameters alpha, rho, nu, and found out that in deed, the SVI fit is always perfect on SABR.</description>

      <description>With a small time expansion, it is easy to derive a reasonable initial guess, without resorting to some global minimizer.
Like Forde did for Heston, one can find the 5 Schobel-Zhu parameters through 5 points at coordinates (0,0), (x0,t1), (-x0,t1), (x0,t2), (-x0,t2), where x0 is a chosen the log-moneyness, for example, 0.1 and t1, t2 relatively short expiries (for example, 0.1, 0.25).
We can truncate the small time expansion so that the polynomial in (x,t) is fully captured by those 5 points.</description>

      <description>Small time expansions for Heston can be useful during the calibration of the implied volatility surface, in order to find an initial guess for a local minimizer (for example, Levenberg-Marquardt). Even if they are not so accurate, they capture the dynamic of the model parameters, and that is often enough.
In 2011, Forde et al. proposed a second order small time expansion around the money, which I found to work well for calibration.</description>

      <description>The paper implied vol for any local stochastic vol model from Lorig et al. presents a very generic and simple formula to compute implied volatility expansions up to order-2 (there is actually an order-3 formula available in their Mathematica CDF file).
I tried it on the Schobel-Zhu stochastic volatility model. This model is an interesting alternative to Heston. I found that, in practice, the implied volatility surface fit was as good, while the simulation under the QE scheme is quite faster (and simpler) than Heston.</description>

      <description>Last week, my work laptop died after spilling out some water on its keyboard inadvertently. Fortunately, its SSD was intact.
As the laptop SSD connector (SATA) and power follow the desktop computers standards, and as I use Linux, I just plugged the SSD to my home desktop and booted off the SSD. I had to change slightly the X configuration but otherwise everything worked. Linux is great for that
The same way, I just plugged the SSD to the desktop at work and it worked.</description>

      <title>Brownian Bridge or Not with Heston Quadratic Exponential QMC</title>

      <description>At first I did not make use of the Brownian Bridge technique in Heston QMC, because the variance process is not simulated like a Brownian Motion under the Quadratic Exponential algorithm from Andersen.
It is, however, perfectly possible to use the Brownian Bridge on the asset process. Does it make a difference? In my small test, it does not seem to make a difference. An additional question would be, is it better to take first N for the asset and next N for the variance or vice versa or intertwined?</description>

      <description>Adjoint algorithmic differentiation is particularly interesting in finance as we often encounter the case of a function that takes many input (the market data) and returns one output (the price) and we would like to also compute sensitivities (greeks) to each input.
As I am just starting around it, to get a better grasp, I first tried to apply the idea to the analytic knock out barrier option formula, by hand, only to find out I was making way too many errors by hand to verify anything.</description>

      <description>Pooley et al., in Convergence Remedies for non-smooth payoffs in option pricing suggest that placing the strike on the grid for a Vanilla option is good enough:
At the same time, Tavella and Randall show in their book that numerically, placing the strike in the middle of two nodes leads to a more accurate result. My own numerical experiments confirm Tavella and Randall suggestion.
In reality, what Pooley et al.</description>

      <description>Recently, I noticed how close are the two PDE based approaches from Andreasen-Huge and Hagan for an arbitrage free SABR. Hagan gives a local volatility very close to the one Andreasen-Huge use in the forward PDE in call prices. A multistep Andreasen-Huge (instead of their one step PDE method) gives back prices and densities nearly equal to Hagan density based approach.
Hagan proposed in some unpublished paper a coordinate transformation for two reasons: the ideal range of strikes for the PDE can be very large, and concentrating the points where it matters should improve stability and accuracy.</description>

      <description>Today, after wondering why my desktop computer became so unstable (frequent crashes under Fedora), I found out that the micro usb port of my cell phone has some kind of short circuit. My phone behaves strangely in 2014, it lasted nearly 1 week on battery (I lost it for half of the week), and seems to shutdown for no particular reason once in a while.
On the positive side, I also discovered, after owning my monitor for around 5 years, that it has SD card slots on the side, as well as USB ports.</description>

      <description>The Fortran minpack library has a good Levenberg-Marquardt minimizer, so good, that it has been ported to many programming languages. Unfortunately it does not support contraints, even simple bounds.
One way to achieve this is to transform the domain via a bijective function. For example, \(a+\frac{b-a}{1+e^{-\alpha t}}\) will transform \(]-\infty, +\infty[\) to ]a,b[. Then how should one choose \(\alpha\)?
A large \(\alpha\) will make tiny changes in \(t\) appear large.</description>

      <description>Several months ago, I took a look at two interesting recent ways to price under SABR with no arbitrage:
One way is due to Andreasen and Huge, where they find an equivalent local volatility expansion, and then use a one-step finite difference technique to price. The other way is due to Hagan himself, where he numerically solves an approximate PDE in the probability density, and then price with options by integrating on this density.</description>

      <description>Prices of a Future contract and a Forward contract are the same under the Black-Scholes assumptions (deterministic rates) but the price of options on Futures or options on Forwards might still differ. I did not find this obvious at first.
For example, when the underlying contract expiration date (Futures, Forward) is different from the option expiration date. For a Future Option, the Black-76 formula can be used, the discounting is done from the option expiry date, because one receives the cash on expiration due to the margin account.</description>

      <description>Using precise vanilla option pricing engine for Heston or Schobel-Zhu, like the Cos method with enough points and a large enough truncation can still lead to spikes in the Dupire local volatility (using the variance based formula).
Local volatility Implied volatility The large spikes in the local volatility 3d surface are due to constant extrapolation, but there are spikes even way before the extrapolation takes place at longer maturities. Even if the Cos method is precise, it seems to be not enough, especially for large strikes so that the second derivative over the strike combined with the first derivative over time can strongly oscillate.</description>

      <description>I always imagined local stochastic volatility to be complicated, and thought it would be very slow to calibrate.
After reading a bit about it, I noticed that the calibration phase could just consist in calibrating independently a Dupire local volatility model and a stochastic volatility model the usual way.
One can then choose to compute on the fly the local volatility component (not equal the Dupire one, but including the stochastic adjustment) in the Monte-Carlo simulation to price a product.</description>

      <description>I did some experiments fitting Heston, Schobel-Zhu, Bates and Double-Heston to a real world equity index implied volatility surface. I used a global optimizer (differential evolution).
To my surprise, the Heston fit is quite good: the implied volatility error is less than 0.42% on average. Schobel-Zhu fit is also good (0.47% RMSE), but a bit worse than Heston. Bates improves quite a bit on Heston although it has 3 more parameters, we can see the fit is better for short maturities (0.</description>

      <description>I recently stumbled upon an error in the various papers related to the Heston Cos method regarding the second cumulant. It is used to define the boundaries of the Cos method. Letting phi be Heston characteristic function, the cumulant generating function is: $$g(u) = \log(\phi(-iu))$$
And the second cumulant is defined a: $$c_2 = g&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;(0)$$Compared to a numerical implementation, the c_2 from the paper is really off in many use cases.</description>

      <description>I tried today the Scala courses on coursera by the Scala creator, Martin Odersky. I was quite impressed by the quality: I somehow believed Scala to be only a better Java, now I think otherwise. Throughout the course, even though it all sounds very basic, you understand the key concepts of Scala and why functional programming + OO concepts are a natural idea. What&amp;rsquo;s nice about Scala is that it avoids the functional vs OO or even the functional vs procedural debate by allowing both, because both can be important, at different scales.</description>

I wrote an enum with a setter like:
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; public static enum BlackVariateType {
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; V0,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ZERO_DERIVATIVE;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; private double volSquare;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; public double getBlackVolatilitySquare() {

The authors rely on the Lewis formula to price vanilla call options under Heston. Lewis formula More importantly, they strongly advise the use of a Black-Scholes control variate. I had read about that idea before, and actually tried it in the Cos method, but it did not improve anything for the Cos method.</description>

      <description>I recently wrote about the Cos method. While rereading the various papers on Heston semi-analytical pricing, especially the nice summary by Schmelzle, it struck me how close were the Attari/Bates methods and the Cos method derivations. I then started wondering if Attari was really much worse than the Cos method or not.
I noticed that Attari method accuracy is directly linked to the underlying Gaussian quadrature method accuracy. I found that the doubly adaptive Newton-Cotes quadrature by Espelid (coteda) was the most accurate/fastest on this problem (compared to Gauss-Laguerre/Legendre/Extrapolated Simpson/Lobatto).</description>

I found that the (complimentary) error function (directly related to the cumulative normal distribution) algorithm relies on an algorithm that can be found in the Faddeeva library.</description>

      <description>Fang, in her thesis, has the idea of the COS method and applies it to Heston. There are several published papers around it to price options under various models that have a known characteristic function, as well as to price more exotic options like barriers or bermudans.
The COS method is very close to the more standard Heston quasi analytic formula (use transform of characteristic function for the density and integrates the payoff with the density, exchanging summation), except that the more simple Fourier series are used instead of the standard Fourier transform.</description>

I also like some of Scilab choices in algorithms: for example it provides PCHIM monotonic spline algorithm, and uses Cody for the cumulative normal distribution.Matlab like software is particularly well suited to express PDE solvers in a relatively concise manner. To illustrate some of my experiments, I started to write a Scilab script for the Arbitrage Free SABR problem. It worked nicely and is a bit nicer to read than my equivalent Scala program.</description>

Where I work we have a similar distinction, although not the same: a simple &amp;ldquo;absolute&amp;rdquo; date object without time vs a relative date (a timestamp) like the JDK Date.
The standard JDK Date class is a date without a time zone, but Sun deprecated in JDK 1.</description>

It seems to rely on some very recent algorithm. There are some a bit older ones: the ancestor, L&amp;rsquo;Ecuyer MRG32k3a that can be parallelized through relatively costless skipTo methods, a Mersenne Twister variant MTGP, and even the less rigourous XorWow popularized by NVidia CUDA.</description>

      <description>As Bessel (sometimes called Hermite) spline interpolation is only C1, like the Harmonic spline from Fritsch-Butland, the forward presents small kinks compared to a standard cubic spline. Hyman filtering also creates a kink where it fixes the monotonicity. Those are especially visible with a log scale in time. Here is how it looks on the Hagan-West difficult curve.</description>

      <description>I discovered that suddenly emails sent to me bounced back yesterday. I logged in my godaddy account and to my surprise saw that I did not own any domain name anymore. I looked at my emails to see if I had received a warning as is usually the case when your domain is about to expire. There was none recent, the most recent was from may 2011, the last time I had renewed my domain.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I do a pet project in Scala, and today, after many trials before, I decided to give another go at Jetbrain Idea for Scala development, as Eclipse with the Scala plugin tended to crash a little bit too often for my taste (resulting sometimes in loss of a few lines of code). I could have just probably updated eclipse and the scala plugin, mine were not very old, but not the latest.</description>

      <description>The theta finite difference scheme is a common generalization of Crank-Nicolson. In finance, the book from Wilmott, a paper from A. Sepp, one from Andersen-Ratcliffe present it. Most of the time, it&amp;rsquo;s just a convenient way to handle implicit \(\theta=1\), explicit \(\theta=0\) and Crank-Nicolson \(\theta=0.5\) with the same algorithm.
Wilmott makes an interesting remark: one can choose a theta that will cancel out higher order terms in the local truncation error and therefore should lead to increased accuracy.</description>

      <description>Today, a friend asked me if Scala could pass primitives (such as Double) by reference. It can be useful sometimes instead of creating a full blown object. In Java there is commons lang MutableDouble. It could be interesting if there was some optimized way to do that.
One answer could be: it&amp;rsquo;s not functional programming oriented and therefore not too surprising this is not encouraged in Scala.
Then he wondered if we could use it for C#.</description>

      <description>On my test of yield curve interpolations, focusing on parallel delta versus sequential delta, Akima is the worst of the lot. I am not sure why this interpolation is still popular when most alternatives seem much better. Hyman presented some of the issues with Akima in his paper in 1983. In the following graph, a higher value is a higher parallel-vs-sequential difference. That plus the Hagan-West example of a tricky curve looks a bit convoluted with it (although it does not have any negative forward).</description>

      <description>I had explored the issue of pricing a barrier using finite difference discretization of the Black-Scholes PDE a few years ago. Briefly, for explicit schemes, one just need to place the barrier on the grid and not worry about much else, but for implicit schemes, either the barrier should be placed on the grid and the grid&amp;nbsp; truncated at the barrier, or a fictitious point should be introduced to force the correct price at the barrier level (0, typically).</description>

      <description>At a presentation of the Thalesians, Hagan has presented a new PDE based approach to compute arbitrage free prices under SABR. This is similar in spirit as Andreasen-Huge, but the PDE is directly on the density, not on the prices, and there is no one-step procedure: it&#39;s just like a regular PDE with proper boundary conditions.
I was wondering how it compared to Andreasen Huge results.
My first implementation was quite slow.</description>

      <description>I am on holiday today. Unfortunately I am still thinking about work-related matters, and out of curiosity, wanted to do a little experiment. I know it is not very good to spend free time on work related stuff: there is no reward for it, and there is so much more to life. Hopefully it will be over after this post.
Around 2 years ago, I saw a presentation from Andreasen and Huge about how they were able to price/calibrate SABR by a one-step finite difference technique.</description>

      <description>Van Haastrecht, Lord and Pelsser present an effective way to price derivatives by Monte-Carlo under the Schobel-Zhu model (as well as under the Schobel-Zhu-Hull-White model). It&#39;s quite similar to Andersen QE scheme for Heston in spirit.
In their paper they evolve the (log) asset process together with the volatility process, using the same discretization times. A while ago, when looking at&amp;nbsp; Joshi and Chan large steps for Heston, I noticed that, inspired by Broadie-Kaya exact Heston scheme, they present the idea to evolve the variance process using small steps and the asset process using large steps (depending on the payoff) using the integrated variance value computed by small steps.</description>

      <description>Where I work, there used to be quite a bit of a confusion on which rates one should use as input to a Local Volatility Monte-Carlo simulation.
In particular there is a paper in the Journal of Computation Finance by Andersen and Ratcliffe &amp;ldquo;The Equity Option Volatility Smile: a Finite Difference Approach&amp;rdquo; which explains one should use specially tailored rates for the finite difference scheme in order to reproduce exact Bond price and exact Forward contract prices</description>

      <description>I have been wondering if there was any better alternative than the standard Sobol (+ Brownian Bridge) quasi random sequence generator for the Monte Carlo simulations of finance derivatives.
Here is what I found:
Scrambled Sobol. The idea is to rerandomize the quasi random numbers slightly. It can provide better uniformity properties and allows for a real estimate of the standard error. There are many ways to do that. The simple Cranley Patterson rotation consisting in adding a pseudo random number modulo 1, Owen scrambling (permutations of the digits) and simplifications of it to achieve a reasonable speed.</description>

      <description>Glasserman and Yu (GY) give a relatively simple algorithm to compute lower and upper bounds of a the price of a Bermudan Option through Monte-Carlo.
I always thought it was very computer intensive to produce an upper bound, and that the standard Longstaff Schwartz algorithm was quite precise already. GY algorithm is not much slower than the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm, but what&#39;s a bit tricky is the choice of basis functions: they have to be Martingales.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s funny I never tried it before even though I use Ubuntu. I did not think it was a dropbox replacement, but it is. And you get 5GB instead of Dropbox 2GB limit, which is enough for me (I was a bit above the 2GB limit).</description>

      <description>In the book Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering, Glasserman explains that if one reuses the paths used in the optimization procedure for the parameters of the exercise boundary (in this case the result of the regression in Longstaff-Schwartz method) to compute the Monte-Carlo mean value, we will introduce a bias: the estimate will be biased high because it will include knowledge about future paths.
However Longstaff and Schwartz seem to just reuse the paths in their paper, and Glasserman himself, when presenting Longstaff-Schwartz method later in the book just use the same paths for the regression and to compute the Monte-Carlo mean value.</description>

      <description>In finance, because one often dicretize the log process instead of the direct process for Monte-Carlo simulation, the Math.exp function can be called a lot (millions of times for a simulation) and can be a bottleneck. I have noticed that the simpler Euler discretization was for local volatility Monte-Carlo around 30% faster, because it avoids the use of Math.exp.
Can we improve the speed of exp over the JDK one?</description>

      <description>I forgot two important points in my previous post about Lord-Kahl method to compute the Heston call price:
Scaling: scaling the call price appropriately allows to increase the maximum precision significantly, because the Carr-Madan formula operates on log(Forward) and log(Strike) directly, but not the ratio, and alpha is multiplied by the log(Forward). I simply scale by the spot, the call price is (S_0*max(S/S_0-K/S0)). Here are the results for Lord-Kahl, Kahl-Jaeckel (the more usual way limited to machine epsilon accuracy), Forde-Jacquier-Lee ATM implied volatility without scaling for a maturity of 1 day: Strike Lord-Kahl Kahl-Jaeckel Forde-Jacquier-Lee 62.</description>

      <description>In my previous post, I explored the Lord-Kahl method to compute the call option prices under the Heston model. One of the advantages of this method is to go beyond machine epsilon accuracy and be able to compute very far out of the money prices or very short maturities. The standard methods to compute the Heston price are based on a sum/difference where both sides are far from 0 and will therefore be limited to less than machine epsilon accuracy even if the integration is very precise.</description>

      <description>I just tried to implement Lord Kahl algorithm to compute the Heston call price. The big difficulty of their method is to find the optimal alpha. That&amp;rsquo;s what make it work or break. The tricky part is that the function of alpha we want to minimize has multiple discontinuities (it&amp;rsquo;s periodic in some ways). This is why the authors rely on the computation of an alpha_max: bracketing is very important, otherwise your optimizer will jump the discontinuity without even noticing it, while you really want to stay in the region before the first discontinuity.</description>

One example is the last number: 16.6. 16.6 does not have an exact representation in double precision, even though it is displayed as 16.</description>

where fint(z) computes the floor of z.
Why 1.6? An integer divided by 1.6 will be an exact representation of the corresponding number in double: 1.6 because of 16 (dividing by 1.</description>

where fint(z) computes the floor of z.
Basically, x*x is rewritten as xsq*xsq+del. I have seen that trick once before, but I just can&amp;rsquo;t figure out where and why (except that it is probably related to high accuracy issues).</description>

The formulas as written in the paper are not usable as is: they can be simplified (not too difficult, but intimidating at first)The numerical integration is not trivial: a simple Gauss-Laguerre is not precise enough (maybe if I had an implementation with more points), a Gauss-Kronrod is not either (maybe if we split it in different regions).</description>

      <description>A Volatility swap is a forward contract on future realized volatility. The pricing of such a contract used to be particularly challenging, often either using an unprecise popular expansion in the variance, or a model specific way (like Heston or local volatility with Jumps). Carr and Lee have recently proposed a way to price those contracts in a model independent way in their paper &amp;ldquo;robust replication of volatility derivatives&amp;rdquo;. Here is the difference between the value of a synthetic volatility swap payoff at maturity (a newly issued one, with no accumulated variance) and a straddle.</description>

I was a bit surprised to notice that the parallelized algorithm ran in some cases twice slower than the same algorithm not parallelized. I tried ForkJoinPool, ThreadPoolExecutor, my one notify/wait based parallelization. All resulted in similar performance compared to just calling thread1.run() and thread2.run() directly.
I am still a bit puzzled by the results.</description>

      <description>I still did not abandon Scala despite my previous post, mainly because I have already quite a bit of code, and am too lazy to port it. Furthermore the issues I detailed were not serious enough to motivate a switch. But these days I am more and more fed up with Scala, especially because of the Eclipse plugin. I tried the newer, the beta, and the older, the stable, the conclusion is the same.</description>

      <description>In my Linux quest, I changed distribution again on my home desktop, from OpenSuse 11.1 with KDE to Ubuntu 13.04 (not yet released - so alpha) with Unity. Why?
KDE was crashing a bit too often for my taste (more than once a week). Although I enjoyed the KDE environment. Not easy to transfer files to my Android 4.2 phone. Ubuntu 13.04 is not fully there yet, but is on its way.</description>

Here is a guide:
involve as many team as possible. It will help ensuring endless discussions about who is doing what, and then how do I interface with them. This is most (in)efficient when team managers interact and are not very technically competent. One consequence is that nobody is fully responsible/accountable, which helps reinforce the productivity zero. meetings, meetings and meetings.</description>

      <description>In Pricing Financial Instruments - The Finite Difference Method, Tavella and Randall explain that boundary conditions using a higher order discretization (for example their &amp;ldquo;BC2&amp;rdquo; boundary condition) can not be solved in one pass with a simple tridiagonal solver, and suggest the use of SOR or some conjugate gradient based solver.
It is actually very simple to reduce the system to a tridiagonal system. The more advanced boundary conditions only use 3 adjacent values, just 1 value makes it non tridiagonal, the one in bold is the following matrix representation</description>

      <description>I was looking for an implementation of the non central chi squared distribution function in Java, in order to price bond options under the Cox Ingersoll Ross (CIR) model and compare to a finite difference implementation. It turned out it was not so easy to find existing code for that in a library. I would have imagined that Apache common maths would do this but it does not.
OpenGamma has a not too bad implementation.</description>

      <description>A while ago, someone asked me to reference him in a paper of mine because I used formulas of a finite difference approximation of a derivative on a non uniform grid. I was shocked as those formula are very widespread (in countless papers, courses and books) and not far off elementary mathematics.
There are however some interesting old papers on the technique. Usually people approximate the first derivative by the central approximation of second order:</description>

      <description>I am comparing various finite difference schemes on simple problems and am currently stumbling upon a strange discontinuity at the boundary for some of the schemes (Crank-Nicolson, Rannacher, and TR-BDF2) when I plot an American Put Option Gamma using a log grid. It actually is more pronounced with some values of the strike, not all. The amplitude oscillates with the strike. And it does not happen on a European Put, so it&#39;s not a boundary approximation error in the code.</description>

      <description>I spent quick a bit of time to figure out why something that is usually simple to do in Java did not work in Scala: Arrays and ArrayLists with generics.
For some technical reason (type erasure at the JVM level), Array sometimes need a parameter with a ClassManifest !?! a generic type like [T :&amp;lt; Point : ClassManifest] need to be declared instead of simply [T :&amp;lt; Point].
And then the quickSort method somehow does not work if invoked on a generic.</description>

      <description>This will be a very technical post, I am not sure that it will be very understandable by people not familiar with the implied volatility surface.
Something one notices when computing an option price under local volatility using a PDE solver, is how different is the Delta from the standard Black-Scholes Delta, even though the price will be very close for a Vanilla option. In deed, the Finite difference grid will have a different local volatility at each point and the Delta will take into account a change in local volatility as well.</description>

I decided to give another try to OpenSuse, as Linux makes it easy to switch system without losing too much time reinstalling the useful applications.
It&amp;rsquo;s been only a few days, but I am pleasantly surprised with OpenSuse. It feels more polished than Kubuntu.</description>

Use of local regression instead of Longstaff Schwartz (or worse CVA like sim of sim). philox RNG from DE Shaw.

      <description>I had the bad idea to upgrade to the beta Ubuntu 12.10. Something awfully broke in the upgrade. After too much struggling with apt-get &amp;amp; dpkg, I decided to install Fedora 17.
Strangely Fedora feels much faster than Ubuntu 12.04 (the boot time especially). Yum seems also faster than apt-get, especially the update part. Also while the Unity dock is not bad (better than gnome shell dock), the Unity dash thing just makes me crazy, the gnome shell activities, while close, are much easier to use.</description>

      <description>How many reports have you had to fill up with a number of stars to choose? How much useless time is spent on figuring the this number just because it is always very ambiguous?
Some blogger wrote an interesting entry on Why I Hate Five Stars Reviews. Basically he advocates binary voting instead via like/dislike. Maybe a ternary system via like/dislike/don&#39;t care would be ok too.
One coworker used to advocate the same for a similar reason: people reading those reports only pay attention to the extremes: the 5 stars or the 0 stars.</description>

This keyboard has excellent reviews on many websites, or even on Amazon. I somehow always found the idea a bit strange, it looked like the old solar panel calculators that used to be trendy when I was in primary school.Well after maybe 6 months of use, he needs to change the battery!</description>

Because of French regulations and bad design, one can enter time for at most 1 day at a time. This is very annoying especially to enter vacation days.

      <description>The Quantlib code to evaluate the Heston integral for European options is quite nice. It proposes Kahl &amp;amp; Jaeckel method as well as Gatheral method for the complex logarithm. It also contains expansions where it matters so that the resulting code is very robust. One minor issue is that it does not integrate both parts at the same time, and also does not propose Attari method for the Heston integral that is supposed to be more stable.</description>

Installing it on Ubuntu 12.04 is simple with this guide. To my surprise it is very stable so far.</description>

In general most complaints i have read about the phone were wrong. The battery is ok, the size is great.</description>

Why Scala? It still seem the most advanced alternative to Java on the JVM, and the mix of functional programming and OO programming is interesting. Furthermore it goes quite far as it ships with its own library.</description>

It is easy to install under ubuntu 11.10 through the backports and seems very stable so far.</description>

      <description>I have never really thought very much about generating random numbers according to a precise discrete distribution, for example to simulate an unfair dice.
In finance, we are generally interested in continuous distributions, where there is typically 2 ways:
the inverse transform (usually computed in a numerical way), and the acceptance-rejection method, typically the ziggurat. The inverse transform is often preferred, because it&amp;rsquo;s usable method for Quasi Monte-Carlo simulations while the acceptance rejection is not.</description>

      <description>I recently tried to minimise a function according to some constraints. One popular method to minimise a function in several dimensions is Nelder-Mead Simplex. It is quite simple, so simple that I programmed it in Java in 1h30, including a small design and a test. It helped that the original paper from Nelder-Mead is very clear:
However the main issue is that it works only for unconstrained problems. Nelder and Mead suggested to add a penalty, but in practice this does not work so well.</description>

      <description>After the upgrate to Ubuntu 11.04 I was directly on Unity. Having a dock on the left side is nice, but unfortunately, it has various bugs which makes it sometimes annoying. Also the menu on top like Mac Os X is not a bad idea, but it breaks many apps (for example Picasa). Then there is the scrollbar insanity, it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to click on to scroll, and again breaks in some apps (for example Eclipse).</description>

      <description>Finally someone who shares the same opinion on the current state of GPGPU programming.
John Carmack: On the other hand, we have converted all of our offline processing stuff to ray tracing. For years, the back-end MegaTexture generation for Rage was done with&amp;hellip; we had a GPGPU cluster with NVIDIA cards and it was such a huge pain to keep. It was an amazing pain where one system would be having heat problems and would be behaving weird even though we thought they had identical drivers.</description>

      <description>I just miraculously received some AKG Q701 headphones. I never tried really high end headphones before those. I was used to my Sennheiser HD555, which I thought were quite good already.
I always thought there was not much difference between let&amp;rsquo;s say a $100 headphone and a $500 one, and that only real audiophiles would be able notice the difference: people like Jake who can distinguish artefacts in 320kbps mp3, but not people like me.</description>

      <description>Since 2007, there is a new kind of Mersenne-Twister (MT) that exploits SIMD architecture, the SFMT. The Mersenne-Twister has set quite a standard in random number generation for Monte-Carlo simulations, even though it has flaws.
I was wondering if SFMT improved the performance over MT for a Java implementation. There is actually on the same page a decent Java port of the original algorithm. When I ran it, it ended up slower by more than 20% than the classical Mersenne-Twister (32-bit) on a 64-bit JDK 1.</description>

      <description>Nvidia uses XorWow random number generator in its CURAND library. It is a simple and fast random number generator with a reasonably long period. It can also be parallelized relatively easily. Nvidia suggests it passes L&#39;Ecuyer TestU01, but is not very explicit about it. So I&#39;ve decided to see how it performed on TestU01.
I found very simple to test a new random number generator on TestU01, the documentation is great and the examples helpful.</description>

      <description>There is an interesting article on how to generate efficiently the inverse of the normal cumulative distribution on the GPU. This is useful for Monte-Carlo simulations based on normally distributed variables.
Another result of the paper is a method (breakless algorithm) to compute it apparently faster than the very good Wichura&amp;rsquo;s AS241 algorithm on the CPU as well keeping a similar precision. The key is to avoid branches (if-then) at the cost of not avoiding log() calls.</description>

I am impressed that Mozilla managed to improve Firefox that much.</description>

      <description>A while ago, I was already looking for a good Java Matrix library, complaining that there does not seem any real good one where development is still active: the 2 best ones are in my opinion Jama and Colt.
Recently I tried to price options via RBF (radial basis functions) based on TR-BDF2 time stepping. This is a problem where one needs to do a few matrix multiplications and inverses (or better, LU solve) in a loop.</description>

      <description>Before Java 1.5, I never really complained about the lack of enum keyword. Sure the old enum via class pattern was a bit verbose at first (N.B.: Java 1.5 enums can also be verbose once you start adding methods to them). But more importantly, you would often use the table lookup pattern in combination.
The problem with Java 1.5 enum is that it is not Object-Oriented. You can&#39;t extend an enum, you can&#39;t add an element in an existing enum.</description>

      <description>I tried Scala a few years ago. There are several good ideas in it, but I found the language to be a bit too complicated to master. But I recently stubbled upon a paper on Scala generics&amp;nbsp;that might change my mind about using Scala.
Scala Generics used to work in a similar way as Java Generics: via type erasure. One main reason is compatibility with Java, another is that C++ like templates make the code base blow up.</description>

Overall it does look like a very American approach to Maths: answering a multiple choices questions test by elimination. But it is still an interesting book.</description>

      <description>I have been a long user of Firefox, mostly thanks to the adblock extension. But recently, Firefox decided to change the way arrows work on the web pages, they don&amp;rsquo;t make the page scroll anymore. Meanwhile Chrome has now a good adblock plugin (that filters ads on load, not after load like it use to be) and is really much much faster than Firefox. So there is no more reason not to use it.</description>

The Applet simulates Diffusion Limited Aggregation as described in Chaos And Fractals from Peitgen, Juergens, and Saupe. It represents ions randomly wandering around (in a Brownian motion) until they are caught by an attractive force in electrochemical deposition experiment.</description>

      <description>In my previous post, I suggest that keeping a double[] performs better than keeping a double[][] if you do matrix multiplications and other operations.
This is actually not true. I benchmarked 3 libraries, Colt (uses double[]), Apache Commons Math (uses double[][]) and Jama (uses double[][] cleverly). At first it looks like Jama has a similar performance as Colt (they avoid [][] slow access by a clever algorithm). But once hotspot hits, the difference is crazy and Jama becomes the fastest (Far ahead).</description>

      <description>Looking for a good Java Matrix (and actually also math) library, I was a bit surprised to find out there does not seem to be any really serious one still maintained.
Sure, there is Apache Commons Math, but it is still changing a lot, and it is not very performance optimized yet, while it has been active for several years already. There is also Java3D, it does Matrix through GMatrix, but not much linear algebra and if you look at their implementation, it is very basic, not performance oriented.</description>

      <description>We ran into an interesting issue with TimeZone and Dates. If you print the same date on different JVMs, it might show a different printed date.
The reason behind this is the daylight saving time conventions. An old JVM won&#39;t necessarily have the same daylight saving time for a given TimeZone than a latest JVM, and therefore will interpret the date differently.
Here is the output of a very simple program on 2 different JVMs.</description>

The explicit method has less issues with barrier options pricing. I will show here what the tricky parts are and why explicit seems simpler in this case.

Killing/restarting pulseaudio, looking at the processes using snd did not work.

      <description>A coworker recently asked me if there was a guaranteed behavior in the case of int overflow. He gave the specific example on:
can we rely that int x = Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1 is the same for every JVM on any platform?
I thought the answer would be easy to find in the Java specifications document. But I was wrong. It is not clearly defined.
I found a trick that suggests this behavior is indeed standard and will stay the same, it is related to type casting.</description>

      <description>There are lots of programs for playing MP3 under linux, a few dealing decently with big libraries. But when you start looking for a program that does crossfade well and manage big libraries easily - there is nothing.
Rhythmbox does some crossfade, but crashes when you move manually in the song. Audacious does some crossfade but regularly crashes with crossfade plugin.
The real alternative are AIMP2 or Foobar2000 in Wine. It is quite incredible that you can have good solid crossfade in wine and not natively in Linux.</description>

      <title>The End Of Rings Around Plain Java - A Better Concurrency Test</title>

      <description>In my previous post, I was wondering why single thread was faster. D Andreou gave the correct explanation: as we send only 1 start message and as each node only send 1 message to the next one, there is always only 1 message being processed. So the test is optimum on 1 thread. It does not make much sense to make a multithreading benchmark on a problem that is fundamentally single threaded.</description>

      <description>A while ago, I had a comment from someone implying I knew nothing about OO programming because I had not mentioned (and therefore read) Object Oriented Analysis And Design with Applications from G. Booch. I was intrigued by such a silly comment and decided to look at this book that was considered as the bible of OOP.
Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t find it that good! But I don&amp;rsquo;t find the bible particularly good either.</description>

      <description>I wrote my previous post too fast. I found a very simple change that increases the speed x6!
The idea is too process messages in a ThreadPoolExecutor. As my Nodes are Runnable, I just needed to initialize a common ThreadPoolExecutor, and in a sendMessage, execute the runnable each time.
Here is the full code: public&amp;nbsp;class&amp;nbsp;OptimizedRing {
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;private&amp;nbsp;ExecutorService executor;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;public&amp;nbsp;static&amp;nbsp;void&amp;nbsp;main(String[]&amp;nbsp;args)&amp;nbsp;throws&amp;nbsp;Exception {
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;OptimizedRing ring = new&amp;nbsp;OptimizedRing();
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;RingNode node = ring.startRing(Integer.parseInt(args[0]));
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;node.sendMessage(new&amp;nbsp;StartMessage());

      <description>Alex Miller has a very interesting test of Actors. He finds out Scala performance is relatively low compared to Erlang, and Kilim is very near Erlang. But Kilim code is the most difficult to read in the lot.
I thought it would be simple to just do the same test in plain Java. I wrote the code for it duplicating the scala logic using Threads instead of Actors.
public class SimpleRing { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { SimpleRing ring = new SimpleRing(); RingNode node = ring.</description>

      <description>We saw in a previous entry how one has to be careful with Double.NaN. Today we will see how regular double can cause problems. By the way the NaN issue was not Java specific and this issue is also general in different programming languages.
A coworker was shocked that in Java (I was a bit surprised he saw that only today, but it is true it can be surprising that such a simple thing does not work as expected):</description>

entwickeln Sie lieber überzeugende Lösungen anstatt viele Stunden mit Coding zu verbringen? Ist Ihnen die Produktivität Ihres Teams wichtig?
Mark Driver, VP Research von Gartner, kommentierte kürzlich
&amp;ldquo;Here’s a simple equation. In terms of mental fortitude&amp;hellip; 1 Smalltalk developer = 2.5 C++ developers 1 C++ developer = 1.5 Java developers&amp;rdquo;.

      <description> I don&#39;t know what Sun had in mind when creating Double.NaN number. It is very inintuitive to use. I am sure every single developer out there fell in the trap of trying to find out if a double was NaN or not using:
Double.NaN == myDouble
This does not work (I don&#39;t know the real reason why), one has to use:
Double.isNaN(myDouble)
Not intuitive! </description>

In the Java world, Grails is the most likely to benefit from it. (&amp;hellip;) It could also be something based around Spring as their current MVC solution is not very good and very old fashioned.&amp;quot;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will be right with the provocative Java is dead.</description>

      <description>These days, I have the feeling that Java is dead. Even if, or maybe because I have used Java so much in the past 10 years, I have this feeling.
In 1998 Java was revolutionary. It was a very simple to learn object oriented language with modern concepts and familiar syntax. Furthermore the standard library had neat features like internet networking and it could be integrated in the browser. All this at a time when the internet just started to be popular.</description>

      <description>It has been now a week since I have installed ArchLinux on my home computer. I daily use Ubuntu 8.10 at work.
Since the Ubuntu upgrade from 8.04 to 8.10 I have had problems with my Xorg settings. I just found out the nvidia-settings utility does not manage to save the configuration anymore. So I have to lookup on google and try to fix it. And that annoys me. That annoys me because the promess of Ubuntu is that everything works out of the box.</description>

      <description>I tried another silly thing with Linux, ArchLinux. The setup is quite rough as you have to edit many config files manually. But if you know a bit your way around it takes only a few hours to have everything running well. The installation manual on the wiki is detailed enough to correct all eventual mistakes humans do.
I decided to try once more KDE 4 on it, as at first it was just a silly experiment: I was really not sure ArchLinux would be workable.</description>

How does a hash table work?
While it is a very interesting question, I doubt many programmers (even relatively good ones) can answer that question. If I look back and think of all the employees in all the companies I have known, I can count on one hand people that can answer that question.</description>

There was a post at one point about the Dante Inferno&amp;rsquo;s problem. It triggered my attention, so I decided to buy the book the post was referring to, The Art of Multiprocessor Programming by M Herlihy and N. Shavit.
The books starts with the basics, and is very didactic in its approach.</description>

Meyer tries to explain in a progressive way why OO is better, by introducing it bit by bit. I have read different related design patterns book, the GoF one, Martin Fowler ones. I have been programming Java for about 10 years now. And yet, today, I feel unconvinced.</description>

I think the OpenBSD crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys
Beside that provoking sentence he has a valid point. Security bugs should not be more important than other bugs. Too often, management and psychology encourage making security bugs a very important issue and security people VIPs. I have seen this over and over.</description>

I changed the system on my home laptop because Ubuntu with KDE 4 was there. I decided to go for something more roots. I had good memories of Gentoo when I tried it some years ago. Maybe I just became too old to appreciate it anymore.</description>

I was surprised as I thought the disk in the desktop would make a big difference. The processor in my desktop is not that great (simple pentium e2180). My laptop has a 2ghz core2duo processor. In Ghz processor are of the same speed.
I tried to overclock my home pc to see what difference it could make, I made it run at 2.</description>

      <description>I tried Firefox 3 twice before, while it was in alpha and beta. I was not impressed at all, it seemed buggy (normal for alpha) and I found the new location bar behavior unintuitive. It did not seem that much faster either. So I always quickly went back to Firefox 2.
I tried again recently, funnily, because of a bad Kernel update. One day, after a kernel update, my laptop started to run only at a max of 800Mhz, I did not notice it immediately.</description>

So writing small experiments for free on the web was difficult. Experiments are back thanks to Google with their AppEngine. Many aspects of it are quite interesting and show where they focus.
First it is all Python. It makes sense as I believe Guido v Rossum, Python creator, works for Google.</description>

      <description>Option, Futures and Other Derivatives is by far the most popular book in finance. You will find it in every finance company, on many desks.
It is a very good introduction for people not familiar with standard financial products. This kind of book is unavoidable to understand the basis. It goes also beyond with the chapters on pricing and hedging. These 2 chapters make one understand many other book. If one understands the Black and Scholze formula, one can easily approach many other pricing formula, as in a way, there are all similar in their approach.</description>

His ideas are presented in a software developer friendly way, as his goal is to show how different equity derivatives products are behind the scenes, very similar.
I enjoyed the variety of exotic products presented and the very detailed way in which they are explained</description>

Thanks to the Ubuntu documentation, it is quite easy to establish a connection manually through hidd commands. It was unfortunately much more difficult to have it automatically recognized and not disconnected after a few minutes without use.
The following configuration should work with any other distro and probably other bluetooth keyboards as well.</description>

The correct behavior should be to throw a parse exception IMHO. Judging from an old post in the Sun bug tracker, The folks at Sun don&#39;t think it really is, they call the default mode of parsing the &#34;</description>

      <description>I have forgotten a few libraries in my Better Swing Development article, and notably MiGLayout.
GridBagLayout is too verbose, and still feels too clumsy. This is why a while back I wrote a small tool to help visualize various GridBagLayouts for people who are not used to it. But it would have been much simpler to use a better layout instead.
MiGLayout is good, I managed to have good results without almost any practices on not so simple layouts.</description>

      <description>Fedora 9 I &amp;ldquo;upgraded&amp;rdquo; my home computer to Fedora 9. &amp;ldquo;upgraded&amp;rdquo; because I reinstalled the OS instead of using the upgrade procedure. I have had so many issues with &amp;ldquo;partial&amp;rdquo; upgrades in the past (with any distro).
Although it is the preview/RC1 version, Fedora 9 is already as stable as a release IMHO. No issues so far, it feels more polished than Fedora 8. OpenJDK 1.6 is there. Firefox 3 is there.</description>

      <description>Externalizing the screen layout is a natural step for many applications. It can be because a customer might want a slightly different presentation, or just for the sake of clearly separating layout code, or for using a kind of screen generator. Back in 2003, I wrote a small utility to help with GridBagLayout, nothing fantastic, but there was the feature of saving a generated layout in XML (or Beanshell) and using it in an application.</description>

      <description>It has been a while since I have looked at the different options for building GUIs in Java. I like the approach taken by Eclipse, they provide not only GUI components, but a complete GUI application framework. Several years ago, I have stolen ideas from it (how they manage plugins) and applied it for Swing applications. This worked out quite well. The Netbeans platform now offers a more interesting alternative if you have to do Swing.</description>

      <description>I had the bad idea of trying (K)ubuntu 8.04 on my home computer. It worked for a few days, but as Ubuntu 8 is still in alpha, changes tend to break everything easily. At one point Wine stopped working, then the DVD, then the sound. I had crashes with USB plug/unplug. It was time to go back to a stable distro. I went back to Fedora 8.
I found out that I had missed some positive sides of Fedora 8 before.</description>

      <description>It has been already 1 year since Windows Vista is out. In my new company, I had a new computer with Vista on it. I quickly installed Ubuntu in dual boot. I was happy with Ubuntu for my work, until I received many Excel files OpenOffice was not able to read properly. I decided to give a try to Vista. My first impression of it when I had the computer was quite negative.</description>

      <title>The 2008 Java Web Framework</title>

      <description>One of my first web framework was a custom one, based on the book Web Development with Java Server Pages. That was in 1999, when Struts was not yet known. But it was web-MVC, very near from what Struts gave later, without the custom tag stuff (custom tags were not yet part of JSP specifications).
Until 2007, Struts was IMHO the most used web framework and the default choice, even though many contenders appeared, with more features, better code.</description>

      <description>I tried KDE4.0 last week, when it was everywhere in the news. I was very disappointed.
I have a long experience of trying beta software, not well known software. I have used Linux since 1998 (partly). I have even used windows beta at one point. And I have seen nothing as crappy as KDE4.0 release.
It is not usable at all.
Now I can understand what are KDE motivations to do such a bad release.</description>

      <description>My previous post about Ubuntu Gutsy vs Fedora 8 was weak. It is difficult to find a very good distro. Depending on the computer, I have had different experiences. On some computers, Ubuntu really shines and work with minimal tweaking. On some others, Ubuntu is unstable/does not handle wireless correctly and Fedora is much more stable.
The main issues I can see with Fedora 8 are:
LVM by default. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is a good idea to go LVM by default since lots of basic tools are still not handling it properly.</description>

      <description>Recently, there was an interesting post about Haskell performance and Haskell parallelization showing Haskell could outperform C on a simple Fibonacci example.
A friend of mine, Peter (that I seem to manage to constantly piss off) thought about it on another level, saying you could achieve a _MILLION_ times better using a direct formula in C or Java, the Binet formula.
I decided to try as the improvement scale seemed a bit surprising.</description>

      <description>I was pretty happy with Ubuntu 7.10, but when Fedora 8 came out I decided to give it a try. Last time I tried it it was Core 2 or something like that, and it was NOT good.
At first Fedora 8 looks quite good, has a good Live CD install, reminiscent of Ubuntu. The positive side is that it is based on the latest Kernel. It manages my Thinkpad T42 very well (suspend, hibernate work).</description>

      <description>I am disappointed about the Jarkarta Commons DbUtils project. I give a link to it, because it&amp;rsquo;s a bad project (even if written in clean code). It is very simple, but it really does not do much for you.
I was looking for a very simple abstraction of JDBC. I thought bringing Spring in my project would be overkill. After trying DbUtils, I think again. It does not help. It does not handle frequent cases well, and it does not save many lines of code.</description>

      <description>I was struggling to find a bug in a very simple application, it ended up being something as simple as using the damned Boolean.getBoolean(&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;) call instead of Boolean.valueOf(&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;).booleanValue() call. The Boolean.getBoolean method is something you almost never need to use, as it checks if a particular system property is true or false. There is a similar method for Integer.getInteger, and a quick google search shows I am not the only one to think those method should never have been part of the basic API for Boolean/Integer.</description>

      <description>I am currently experimenting with Scala. It seems quite convenient for web applications. Using Tomcat, it is possible to have a very productive developer environment.
Here is a sample Embedded Tomcat you can start in a Scala project:
import&amp;nbsp;java.io._;
import&amp;nbsp;org.apache.catalina._;
import&amp;nbsp;org.apache.catalina.startup._;
object&amp;nbsp;TomcatScalaServer&amp;nbsp;{

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;val&amp;nbsp;WEBAPPS&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;File&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;new&amp;nbsp;File(CATALINAHOME,&amp;#34;webapps&amp;#34;);

I use Quod Libet for Audio, it has similar interface as iTunes, with more features (ability to play most audio formats). I chose Quod Libet instead of the standard Rhythmbox because of its practical mp3 tags handling.</description>

      <description>Spring Web Services seems to be the technology I have been looking for recently. I am not a Spring bigot (too XML oriented), but here the Spring folks have something right.
I used to work with Web Services the simple way: create a java class (or EJB), expose it as Web Service through Axis or RAD, generating the WSDL in the process. And then a client would just be the reverse, take the WSDL, use a tool (Axis or RAD) that creates client Java classes from it automatically.</description>

      <description>After seeing Scala had elements of Erlang through Actors, I decided to take a closer look at the language. There is an interesting new web framework in Scala, called Lift. One drawback of Lift is that it seems to be very cutting edge and not that easy to grasp. While reading its source code, I stumbled upon a strange pattern: Storing the ServletRequest in a ThreadLocal.
I had not seen that before, and was wondering why one would do such a thing.</description>

First line is to avoid menus in French.
The font (you can find here) is simply the best programmer&amp;#39;s font.

      <description>Initially I adopted Eclipse instead of Emacs because it was more powerful to search code, and it allowed refactoring. I regularly tried other IDEs but always end up back to Eclipse, even though there has been less big improvements in Eclipse in the past years (but lots of small ones).
I just saw today that Eclipse allowed programmatic refactoring. Now that&amp;rsquo;s something quite amazing, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think other IDEs do that yet.</description>

      <description>Getting started with Tapestry 5 is easier than with Wicket 1.3. Some readers will complain that it is again the view of someone who has no deep knowledge of either Tapestry or Wicket. But I think it is important for projects to be easily accessible to developers. Wicket seems to have more buzz around these days, and has a detailed wiki with plenty of useful information in it. But that&amp;#39;s the problem I see with Wicket, it is not simple to do simple things, that is why there is so much information to do simple things in the Wicket wiki.</description>

      <description>This is not something I would have though a few years ago. It is something I learnt after working on many different projects, some using an ORM layer like Hibernate, Entity EJBs, or JDO, some using JDBC approach via Spring Templates or custom frameworks. Many projects that use ORM have performance problems, that don&amp;#39;t seem that common with projects using JDBC. But the size of the database model of ORM projects is often much bigger than the one of JDBC projects (which actually makes sense).</description>

      <description>I recently found a bug in software we are developing. I traced it and found the root was improper JDBC handling. The application is written using EJBs, Spring and plenty of other relatively complex technologies. I was surprised that developers who were able to use all those technologies had no understanding of basic JDBC.
They fetched all the data (including double, decimal numbers) from the database as String using rs.getString() !</description>

      <description>IBM RAD comes with many wizards, to create EJBs, to create Web Services, do struts mapping&amp;hellip; They are quite well done, making EJB &amp;lt; 3.0 usable, and Web Services look simple.
But wizards sucks at:
typos correction repetition But when you do a typo in your wizards, then all the files generated/changed are wrong, and you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily know if you can just do a search and replace. Plus you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily know all the files that were affected by the typo.</description>

      <description>My first trials of Maven were failures. As I am stubborn, I tried again, on a new project, a quite simple one. It works, but it makes some easy things overkill. And the default way of using it makes a developer lose lots of time.
If I have a project with common classes, a standalone app, and a web app, then logically you do 3 projects, 2 of them depending on the common one.</description>

      <description>Not having good internet connection can be problematic to download new libraries, read or search for documentation on development subjects. But not having a good internal network connection is killer of productivity. It means sometimes not being able to access integration, preprod or even production environment, or ssh session not responding in the middle of an action. As software makes an increasing use of the network, it means not being able to test or to use correctly all kind of software.</description>

There is nothing more annoying than having people in conference call in front of you while you are trying to work on something completely different. French people forgot the cubicle part in the American open space idea. So sometimes the room is just a big mess, everybody being able to disturb you anytime.</description>

      <description>Some companies do it naturally, some really don&amp;rsquo;t. In small companies, it is almost natural, people will make a newcomer productive very quickly. In a big company it&amp;rsquo;s not the same game.
Some important points are:
Computer ready the first day, well sized (right ram, right power, developers are not MS office users), right OS. I had experience with having not the right amount of ram, not the right version of OS, not the right user rights to install and use critical software for my work, and all those were known from the team.</description>

      <description>I was recently in a meeting where use case complexity was estimated using numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. I was surprised by the choice of the Fibonacci sequence. Why not any sequence? Why a particular one? I googled and found the culprit, Mr Mike Cohn in his book Agile Estimating and Planning. It&amp;rsquo;s actually not a bad sequence to choose, since the scale is increasing constantly, so by picking up numbers in this sequence, you can quite accurately describe estimation.</description>

      <description>This will seem obvious, unfortunately, when people are involved, nothing is that obvious. It&amp;rsquo;s not because you setup a bug/feature management software that people will use it. You have to force people to go through the bug management software each time they want something fixed. If you don&amp;rsquo;t do that some people will keep sending incomplete mails, or worse call you to get something fixed, that will be forgotten in a week.</description>

      <title>How to Build Good Software? Have a good build process</title>

      <description>Important points are: standard code hierarchy, automatic download of dependencies, a distribution command with versioning support and source control interaction, a simple command to build each part of the project. In Java best candidates are a sophiticated ant build, or maven2. Maven2 is quite good since it forces you to do some of those steps, even though I think ant can&amp;rsquo;t really be avoided for many more specific tasks.
Once, I got wrong code before I left for a customer site, because code given to the customer was not checked into a source repository everytime before it was given to the customer.</description>

      <description>In an open space, people keep on coming to discuss various issues with various people, issues that have nothing to do with your work. You end up either being distracted, or annoyed by the increased noise level.
Apparently at Microsoft, they have private offices for each programmer. It might be extreme, paradoxally not in the XP (extreme programming) sense, but it is much better than open space for productivity. In XP, it&amp;rsquo;s almost the opposite with 2 developers working often together.</description>

      <description>If you have to lay off in your job, do it quickly. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand companies that want to keep someone as long as legally possible when this someone wants to leave. First the employee won&amp;rsquo;t be as motivated, but more importantly, you will continue to train that person to your company&amp;rsquo;s software and ways of work. This would be much better used on another person, that will stay in the company.</description>

      <description>Someone modified a simple launch script on a integration machine. This pissed off the author of the script. Why?
Just because the guy who modified the script never worked before with the author of the script. If only the author had been notified verbally or by mail of the modification, he would have been happy. Furthermore this would increase the quality of the change since the new guy might have made a change that has other impacts, that the author will best evaluate quickly.</description>

      <description>I am starting a series of posts about software construction, based on good and bad experiences while working for my many employers.
&amp;ldquo;Software construction (a.k.a. architecture), is the only activity that&amp;rsquo;s guaranteed to happen on every project&amp;rdquo;. It is not rare that projects or new features are abandoned either because they are too costly, or because they are not needed anymore, or because they are other more important priorities.
In the same vein: &amp;ldquo;Measure twice, cut once&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I am currently quite busy learning about Websphere Commerce. I was surprised to notice that they still use Entity EJBs 1.1. My experience was that many companies turned away from Entity EJBs, sometimes from the beginning, preferring TopLink or Hibernate (later).
I know that Entity EJBs are more heavy to use than Hibernate, but with the proper tooling support, it&amp;rsquo;s not really a big issue. Are there more fundamental reasons? There are probably some mapping limitations, but IBM implementation is apparently quite good in term of features.</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s it, I have done it, the unthinkable. I have switched from MacOs X to Windows XP. My idea was first to install Ubuntu on the Mac Mini, but if you want to keep the Mac Os X install, the methods I have read on the web required to use bootcamp. At around the same time I was annoyed by problems I had with bluetooth and Skype in MacOs.
So, with bootcamp installed I decided to give a try to Windows.</description>

I find out that I almost never use my tags, and I am often not satisfied by results when I search using tags. What use can you make of 100s of tags? in the end only less than 10 are usable to classify very different stuff. And even then compared to a search it&amp;rsquo;s not a much useful classification.</description>

&amp;nbsp; {
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (instance != null)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; throw new RuntimeException(&amp;quot;Only one instance allowed&amp;quot;);
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; prods = new HashMap();
&amp;nbsp; }
&amp;nbsp; public static ProductYP getInstance() &amp;nbsp; {
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return instance;
&amp;nbsp; }
And I don&amp;#39;t think it was done by a newbie... It&amp;#39;s actually not far from being correct, it&amp;#39;s just that the guy obviously does not know about private constructors.</description>

      <description>I used to like the java specialists newsletter, most news used to be a bit challenging. Nowadays however the quality is lower. In the latest news, the author proposes to use the StackTrace to get the class name, in order to declare a Logger independently of any explicit reference to the class name.
While this is a clever hack, it still requires some code to be duplicated in every class, compared to Aspect/IoC approach.</description>

Firstly one has to learn another templating system.</description>

great I don&amp;rsquo;t need to do any JavaScript
I recently discovered another similar open source project, ZK. The first thing you can read on the website is
ZK is an open source Ajax Web framework that enables rich user interface for web applications with no JavaScript and little programming.</description>

because Maven2 requires to adapt your project to its standard hierarchy, or to have excellent Maven2 skills to create your own archetype for each existing project.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine had a good idea for a Java project named &amp;ldquo;hibernate proxy&amp;rdquo;. I renamed it &amp;ldquo;hibernate network proxy&amp;rdquo; because hibernate proxies are already a well known concept among hibernate users (it allows lazy loading through a Java Proxy class).
The hibernate network proxy, is a way to use hibernate remotely, that is to proxy hibernate calls through TCP (or even HTTP) to another machine, that will execute the session.</description>

      <description>One important feature of Java language is the package keyword. It helps a lot in modularizing your code. But how exactly one should use it is not that clear.
I have been on projects where 100s of classes are in a same package and more often where you have packages for every 2 classes. Often, packages are chosen so as to split functionalities. But often as well, people are packages maniacs and create way too many of them, because they want to sort things out, not necessarily applying a consistent logic.</description>

      <description>I was amazed today to find out that there was no constructor IOException(String, Throwable) or IOException(Throwable) in JDK1.4 and JDK1.5. It is finally in JDK1.6, I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it took Sun that much time to change that.
So the workaround is:
`IOException ioe = new IOException(&amp;quot;message&amp;quot;);` `ioe.initCause(e);` `throw ioe;` It can also be written as:
`throw (IOException) new IOException(&amp;quot;message&amp;quot;).initCause(e);` It is not a major problem, but still. We can all thank the guy who reported that as a bug to Sun in 2004.</description>

For a long time, I shared a similar opinion. But now that I have used it, I get it. I only use it for defining replaceable services, so when I talk about Spring, I mean spring-core and spring-beans.
These two packages are not big, and have only very few dependencies.</description>

      <description>Did you know what happens in Java when you serialize a subclass of a non serializable class? I was surprised by the answer: it works!
Unfortunately it is not a good thing, because it will serialize fields from your subclass and no fields from the parent class. So you&#39;ll end up with a half serialized instance.
In .NET, it breaks at runtime, throwing an exception, which is I think, much more logical, because then you don&#39;t end up with half data somewhere.</description>

Unfortunately for Google, under Linux at least, I don&amp;rsquo;t find Google Spreadsheets usable for anything else than storing and sharing some information, not often updated. Although I admire the engineers that managed to write the Javascript behind Google Spreasheet, it is way too slow for using it in interesting ways.</description>

I am sure many of you are confronted with programmers that love procedural programming in many of your projects. They might use an OO language but in the end will organize everything by &amp;ldquo;type&amp;rdquo;, split invariably state and logic.</description>

      <description>I changed job recently. In this new job, it is refreshing to see Java used like in the old days, without the J2EE layers, and without the extra IBM layers of my previous job. Granted, the fresh Java approach does not apply to many projects, because a lot of apps are just about interfacing a database with a web interface. But Spring success showed that even for many of those projects, fresh Java approach with a small framework is enough.</description>

      <description>Javablogs.com top 10 weekly/monthly/yearly entries were starting to pollute my blog too much for my taste. It is more appropriate to dedicate a blog to them. That is what I should have done in the first place as it is very easy to have many blogs with blogger.com.
So you&amp;rsquo;ll find at javabuzz.blogspot.com the weekly top 10 most read entries on Javablogs, and sometimes more.</description>

      <title>JSF Was Too Hard for Experienced Developers</title>

      <description>While starting to look into Seam, I noticed that all examples use JSF for the view, and there is no alternative to it. If someone like Gavin (from Hibernate fame) thinks JSF is usable, then I probably overlooked something when I looked into it a few years ago, when JSF was the craze of the moment.
At the beginning, JSF looks very similar to ASP.NET. But I have a small experience with ASP.</description>

      <title>On EJB Restrictions - Can You Open a Socket?</title>

      <description>During job interviews, one of the frequent questions is
&amp;ldquo;What restrictions are imposed on EJBs?&amp;rdquo;.
I had a chat recently with someone about it, and we still don&amp;rsquo;t agree on the answer.
He believes we can&amp;rsquo;t open sockets, while I believe it is perfectly allowed, if you don&amp;rsquo;t retain the socket connection between method calls. His arguments are based on an analogy with files. After all in Linux, files are sockets.</description>

      <description>Some time ago I did quite a lot of IO in Java and I yet did not see this way of reading a InputStream from a Socket:
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;InputStream&amp;nbsp;in=channel.getInputStream();
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;channel.connect();
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;byte[]&amp;nbsp;tmp=new&amp;nbsp;byte[1024];
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;while(true){
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;while(in.available()&amp;gt;0){
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;int&amp;nbsp;i=in.read(tmp,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1024);
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;if(i&amp;lt;0)break;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;System.out.print(new&amp;nbsp;String(tmp,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;i));
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;if(channel.isClosed()){
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;System.out.println(&amp;#34;exit-status:&amp;nbsp;&amp;#34;+channel.getExitStatus());
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;break;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;try{Thread.sleep(1000);}catch(Exception&amp;nbsp;ee){}
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;channel.disconnect(); This comes from a piece of code from an example of JSch , a good ssh client in java. A work collegue had the bad idea to remove the Thread.</description>

      <description>Java is supposed to be much better to build big projects, because of static type checking, and all the rigour around the language. But how many of you have seen medium sized projects taking more than 30 minutes to build.
At work, they have a standard J2EE project, with only about 50 EJBs, hundreds of JDO classes, and standard classes. Between the JDO generation, EJB generation, EJB dependencies calculations, and packaging, it takes 20 minutes.</description>

      <description>Every week, I post javablogs top 10 most read blog entries on this blog. The reason for it was that I don&#39;t look at what&#39;s happening on the week-end and this will pickup interesting stories from the weekend, and I also don&#39;t watch javablogs everyday. Overall I find it quite good to be uptodate with interesting stuff happening on javablogs.
As mentionned in an earlier post my library of choice to do the parsing is htmlparser (on sourceforge) because it&#39;s free, open source and because I am lazy and did not want to do my own.</description>

I will present here a short tutorial on how to use EhCache for people who don&#39;t want to look around the documentation at first, but just want to test if it works in their project and to see how easy it is to setup.

      <description>I am not particularly a fan of&amp;nbsp; JCS (Jakarta Cache System) as I find ehcache code very clean and simple. But I have to say the author has some good comments on the site: &amp;nbsp; Nulls vs. Errors &amp;nbsp; I started to support ObjectNotFoundExceptions for failed gets but the overhead and cumbersome coding needed to surround a simple get method is ridiculous. Instead the JCS return null. &amp;nbsp; For having seen too many times the ObjectNotFoundException &amp;quot;pattern&amp;quot;, I can only agree!</description>

      <description>The book Algorithms in Java is huge, but unlike the usual huge books, the content is very interesting. It can be used as reference material, or as toilet book (to learn things while you&#39;re wasting time in the toilets).
You will learn simple things, like what is the &#34;raison d&#39;être&#34; of linked lists. The author gives very good examples to illustrate his propositions. He explains through the sieve of erathostene and through Josephus problem the advantages of arrays or linked list.</description>

      <description>Caching HTTP response can dramatically improve performance of your app if what you generate is in reality not very dynamic. There are many free caching frameworks in Java. Most popular seem to be ehcache, oscache, jcs and JBoss Cache.
ehcache is quite simple to use and its code is clean. They have a CachingFilter that you can put in your webapp server to cache transparently HTTP responses. However as the framework only allows you to store Objects (which makes sense for most uses), I was wondering how they cached the HttpResponse which is a stream.</description>

Errors seem to be largely related to WSDL to Java conversion.

      <description>The French Way
In many French books/lessons (a lesson here, another from caen university , one from UQAM), UML composition does not seem to mean the same as their English counterparts. They write:
Si l&#39;agrégat est détruit (ou copié), ses composants le sont aussi.or les composants (en tant qu&#39;ils sont composants) ont une durée de vie incluse dans celle de leur composé.
translated to English:
If the aggregate is destroyed (or copied), its components are destroyed (or copied) as well.</description>

      <description>Yesterday a work collegue made the remark that the notions of aggregation and composition were not very clear. I was a bit surprised at first. But I actually almost always use just associations relations, sometimes composition, I was not sure anymore about the difference between aggregation and association and the one between composition and aggregation. I had to look up in a book to remember what it was all about.</description>

In the part about functional decomposition where he argues pro and cons of top-down / bottom-up approaches, he has the intuition of the current SOA hype. By showing that
Real systems have no top.
He suggests that the only way to build complex software is through a service oriented architecture. Of course SOA is a very old concept.</description>

      <description>Not easy to choose a downsampling algorithm. Some links:
mplayer: advises bilinear for quality and describes artifacts for each algo a blogger: advises lanczos. This links shows pictures produced by each algo.
digital image interpolation: seems to have a preference for bicubic, what photoshop uses. videohelp: tested various algorithms and think Bicubic spline is the best.People don&#39;t seem to agree. If you want to check the theory: wikipedia lanczos</description>

      <description>Recently, I looked for a way to get info from some particular blog entries of mine on blogger.com. Blogger used to offer an XML-RPC API . They even designed a version 2 of the XML-RPC API that does not seem to have ever been put in production. Or maybe I did not manage to make it work. I had no problem to make v1 work, however. I used apache XMLRPC v2, it was very simple to use.</description>

      <description>Have you ever used the Authenticator class? It is standard since JDK 1.2. This allows you to establish authenticated HTTP requests. OnJava has an in-depth article presenting it. Now here is my story about it.The other day I just wanted to do that a simple authenticated HTTP request. You would expect it to be very simple to do in the modern internet world. It is actually not very difficult to do, by hand, a JavaWorld article presents this way.</description>

2003
Programming Jakarta Struts (O&#39;Reilly - Chuck Cavaness) much better than Manning book. Explains struts very clearly with a more interesting example. Not enough on how to design your application for use with the evil ActionForm. Almost nothing on Struts 1.1 features. Nothing on common problems encountered while building web applications, or even about on how to design them using struts.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I had some free time to finally find out why MacOs X would not display my little applet properly. I checked various JDKs for MacOs, no difference. I checked if it was due to antialiasing use, no luck. I actually found out there was an error in the way I displayed images. I did not call repaint() between each image change. Strangely, it worked fine on Windows with many JDKs.</description>

With Firefox 1.5, display of saved documents was not working properly anymore due to a change in Firefox handling of security permissions to view local files.</description>

      <description>Last year, I have helped building an AJAX web application, where the web client was composed of only one web page and tons of javascript. The 1 web page for a site approach is similar to Gmail and many full AJAX sites. This approach looks quite elegant. Using JSON (and JSON templates) we were able to separated fully presentation logic and business logic and componentization seemed to occur naturally.
But I remember how often I complained on how bad Javascript was to code.</description>

However I was a bit disappointed by iPhoto 6, it is not as nice as Picasa to sort out pictures (no IPTC support). I did not try Java on it yet. I just found out my little Benham circle applet was not working properly on it.</description>

      <description>Bertrand Meyer describes in his book &amp;quot; Object Oriented Software Construction (2nd Ed)&amp;quot; qualities that a good object oriented language should have. Java has almost all the features. Ruby is much farther off, which does not mean it is not a good language, I think it&#39;s very good to write some types of programs quickly (should I call them scripts?), syntax is quite nice, but it does lack the following useful features: Assertions:The language should make it possible to equip a class and its features with assertions (preconditions, postconditions and invariants), relying on tools to produce documentation out of these assertions and, optionally, monitor them at run time.</description>

      <description>Occasionally in Ant you can see messages like this:
&amp;quot;[javac] Using modern compiler&amp;quot; What does this mean? In Ant you have the property &amp;quot; build.compiler&amp;quot; to specify if you want to use a classic or modern compiler. Now what do they mean by modern or classic. Well, they call classic compiler the compilers of JDK 1.1 and 1.2 and they call modern compiler the ones of JDK 1.3+. They made that distinction because a classic compiler does not support the same options as modern compilers: the semantics of javac tool changed in JDK 1.</description>

      <description>These days we tried to make Websphere and Jonas interoperate. Some EJBs are deployed in Jonas and we just try to call them from Websphere. The most natural way is to use RMI (with JRMP) for that. Jonas uses JDK1.4.2 (conforms to J2EE 1.4) and Websphere IBM JVM 1.3.1 (conforms to J2EE 1.3). Because of RMI serialization, an EJB from Jonas will not work on Websphere, because this EJB has references to J2EE 1.</description>

Clustering the web server and clustering the model are just two parts of clustering, not exclusive.
In a LAMP application, clustering the model is traditionally done by clustering the DB (MySQL) which is a no brainer.</description>

      <description>The latest well done (e.g. blind) listening test comparing Ogg, MPC, MP3, AAC at about 180kbps shows that Ogg is superior to all other compressing formats. It&amp;rsquo;s not that easy to find relevant tests. Many people claim to be able to notice huge differences between CD and MP3 and yet, but confronted to a blind listening test, they are very surprised how difficult it actually is.

What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite design pattern?
I was first surprised at the question. Usually a design pattern is about solving a problem not about a personal preference. I wondered if it was a trick question of some sorts. I was hesitating with my answer and asked more about the meaning of the question. I just had to really give the pattern I liked the most!</description>

      <description>I just finished reading Professional Portal Development With Open Source Tools (Wiley).
The Good:
I enjoyed Chapter 1, it gives a good presentation of Portlets for someone who does not know much about it. It is a chapter one can use as a reference to verify some specific details of how Portlets are working. It is a bit similar to JSR 168 specifications, but I found it more detailed and well written.</description>

      <description>I digged a bit deeper in a current project where they use IBM Websphere Portal Server (WPS) with IBM Web Content Management (WCM). I found out that both products collide and disintegrate.
WCM is like a regular content management system, quite flexible and performant on its own. It has a nice way to separate layout concern from content concern. It has a flexible cache. It has a user repository to set different permissions.</description>

      <description>Recently, I have had my first encounter with Portlets although Portlets are not very new. IBM had their own Portlet API before the JSR 168 was final in 2003. Unfortunately both approaches are quite different and IBM does not recommend the use of their own API.
Portlets were a needed concept for a long time. I worked in 2000 on a java portal system and it would have been handy at that time.</description>

Artificial Intelligence through Prolog, by Neil C. Rowe (Prentice-Hall): if you don&#39;t remember much about Prolog, it&#39;s a good book. It details how Prolog interpreters work. File Systems Forensic Analysis, by Brian Carrier (Addison Wesley): everything you need to know about disks and file systems, every trick to recover lost data.</description>

      <description>I find the mac mini a particularly compelling computer. It is small, noise friendly, relatively cheap. If you want to have a cheap home server (based on Linux or MacOS X), this is quite a good choice as you probably don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear all the fans of bigger computers the whole day. It&amp;rsquo;s also a very good candidate for a media box: you can connect a huge hard drive for mp3s, and watch your DVDs, photos on a nice LCD (and MacOS helps here).</description>

      <description>In 1998, a student of my school had a project with Sun about EJBs. This was the beginning of EJBs, they were not public, and there was no J2EE. At that time he found it utterly complicated, and had difficulties to understand why they made it so complicated.
In 2000, I worked for a company who had built in-house most components of a today J2EE application server. For example, they had their own unified messaging system, on the JSP side, they were already using custom tags, etc.</description>

In France, it is common to have 5 interviews for a small company (that says a bit about how people trust each other and makes me envy Germany where the practice is to select very strictly on the resume and be more relax about interviews).</description>

      <description>Slashdot presented a really insightful article on Visual Studio by Charles Petzold called Does Visual Studio Rot the Mind. Interestingly it seems that Eclipse does things better than the future Visual Studio.
Autocomplete in Eclipse is really good and does not suffer of the bottom-up problem M. Petzold mentioned, nor from the forced CTRL-Z. There is no Form designer, and in Java it has been the practice to lay out forms programmatically.</description>

Compare that to javablogs.com blogs aggregation, every week there are many interesting posts. The blog model is good because it is targeted at people who want to write.</description>

      <description>I am completing my Spring Books Roundup with 2 new books:
Pro Spring, by Apress: a lengthy book, with some unnecessary information, but good overall. I did not like the Part 1, there is not much content in it. Fortunately, Part 2 is much better, dependency injection is very well described, almost on par, with the Fowler article of reference. Other Spring areas are well covered, in a similar manner as in Wrox book, except Java Server Faces, absent from the book, and nothing on Swing as well Spring Reference Documentation, from the springframework.</description>

      <description>Spring is hip these days, so I decided to learn a bit more about it. I had used Avalon a while ago, I was attracted by its design by component and the way it seemed to lay out a proper infrastructure to build a server application. In the end, I was a bit disappointed, it required a bit too much glue code for my taste and did not provide that much in exchange.</description>

      <description>Today, I just found out about DPML Transit, it is a small framework that helps you build plug-ins based software. It seems to work a bit with DPML Magic, their build system based upon Ant. Both are quite interesting, since in big projects, you often end up with a packaging per component (which DPML Magic seems to make very simple) and a versioning of those components. DPML Transit allows then for an efficient way to look up a particular version of one component.</description>

      <description>The book Java Puzzlers is quite good. I don&#39;t think anyone can get every puzzle right. This shows again how you can very easily make someone fail interviews if you ask too silly questions.

Here is a sample:

      <title>Is Prolog Better Suited Than SQL?</title>

      <description>I am currently reading a Prolog book Artificial Intelligence Through Prolog, I have been doing a bit of Prolog when I was very young and wanted to refresh my memory a bit. It is a very interesting read, especially when I take the viewpoint of our current application where no ACID compliance is required.
It seems to me that all the logic we coded to parametrize SQL queries and construct them dynamically could have been avoided if we had chosen Prolog as Prolog expressions would have been very natural to use in our project.</description>

      <description>In bamboo-dht, a distributed java hashtable project, the main developer, Sean C. Rhea, advocates the use of Curries and Thunks (of LISP and ML). He wrote an interesting and valuable document, Async Tutorial, presenting a use of it. I will present the concept here shortly:
public interface Thunk1&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; { void run (T t ) ; }
Thunk1&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; intThunk = new Thunk1&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;() {
void run (Integer i ) { System.out.println( i ) ; }</description>

      <description>I took some time to continue my little JavaBlogs analysis, I now have a page summarizing the top 10 most read blog entries in the last week. The page is generated every 24h (this is why there is no &amp;lsquo;best progression&amp;rsquo; as of today).
I also fixed some bugs related to HTML in RSS2. I understand a bit better why a RSS 1.0 co-author decided to remove the possibility of HTML descriptions for RSS 3.</description>

      <description>I was a victim like many other of spams in comments. It&amp;rsquo;s stupid for people to do that on Blogger.com since the links on comments can not be referenced by search engines (they have some special &amp;lsquo;relative&amp;rsquo;attribute for that) and improve pagerank.
Fortunately Blogger.com provides a word verification step if you want to avoid random spam. However I am a bit disappointed that they force Blogger.com users to do that word verification as well.</description>

      <description>I was wondering what blog entries were the most interesting on Javablogs. I decided to write a small application to do that. It was not much more complex to put it online for others to look at as well. It is currently running on http://gopix.net:8081/javabuzz
It also presents Javablogs a bit differently (I like it better that way).
Please note that it is just the result of a 1 (full) day of work currently.</description>

      <description>The BeanUtil.popupate(bean,map) can be very handy, but if you care about performance, it is quite slow. I ran a micro benchmark on my machine (centrino 1.8ghz, JDK1.5) and found out that BeanUtils is up to 40x slower than a hand coded solution (where I assign each bean field manually). I was a bit surprised to find such a difference. I suppose there is a big penalty for using reflection and another big one for the BeanUtils abstraction (automatic casting, etc.</description>

      <description>There are some open source projects that can help you in generating or reading RSS feeds in Java. I found only two libraries a bit mature, other code is often embedded in other open source products (jroller for example):
Informa: Does various RSS formats and Atom 0.3. Documentation is better than its alternative, but less focused (has some hibernate helper thingy, some lucene helper, etc.).
Sandler: There is no working homepage while I am writing this.</description>

      <description>I was writing an Atom feed generator for my current project. I chosed to support Atom 1.0 since it looks like it has the capabilities to establish as the next standard. Unfortunately I quickly saw that it was quite hard to test it in the real world (out of the good feedvalidator), as almost nobody seems to accept Atom 1.0 feeds yet, even if it is rapidely changing (there is support for it in Firefox CVS version).</description>

      <description>I like the new Google Desktop with the sidebar. It shares similarities with Konfabulator, recently bought by yahoo. They both allow easy access to some custom little widgets that I would call &#34;active&#34;. They are active because they are refreshed periodically with new information (processor usage, news, scratch pad, emails, etc). But while Konfabulator choose to emphasize on visual effects, Google prefers a more standard information presentation. This shows as well in their choice of technologies:</description>

      <description>I am currently facing a problem that neither Hibernate nor iBatis solves nicely. I also looked at other ORM or just DB framework, without success.
What I would need is a framework that generates PreparedStatements with a query by Criteria like API. I have many queries that are similar but varying according to different input parameters. iBatis can handle this, but for complex queries and scenarios, the XML becomes completely unreadable, and you therefore loose any advantage that iBatis was bringing with the externalization of SQL statements in XML.</description>

      <description>When I bookmark articles with delicious, I like to keep the content on my hard drive, because pages sometimes change, or are removed, or I want to do local searches. I believe this is one reason some people like furl (furl keeps a copy on their server that only yourself can read, but does not allow search).
A combination of slogger and delicious could solve partially the problem. But it is not integrated, I can&#39;t get my local version from delicious, so I loose the tagging, listing and all other plus from delicious.</description>

      <description>I am reading an old book, Inside the Java Virtual Machine. Some old books don&#39;t age, and this is one of them. The chapter on the Java Virtual Machine is just excellent and should be read by every Java developer. It explains each step a JVM does when you run a Java program, very clearly.
You could get plenty of stupid interview questions from it like: How is the Java stack used?</description>

Recently, someone started YubNub, the &#34;command line for the web&#34;, a very simple idea, but useful. This is a bit similar to the Firefox Search Bar, except more powerful, and quicker to use. Mozilla developers actually had that idea a long time ago (around 2000), it is called shortcut url.</description>

      <description>I was wondering what was the framework weight in the performance of my application, and I wanted to check at several frameworks performance. I used JMeter to benchmark a stripped application (database access through tomcat) under various loads. My very modest test shows no significant difference between Hibernate Criteria API and HQL access for queries. Criteria might be a few milliseconds slower, but my query time will take 10x more time, even for a relatively simple query (my query is has 3 inner joins, is grouped, with a count and takes only 4ms when performed once in mysql under no load).</description>

      <description>I have been doing some Ruby On Rails, for 2 small projects. While I think it is good, I think it is overhyped as well. It is well designed, has good ideas (easy configuration), and focus on the right problem, architecture. But my conclusion is that I am not more productive with it than with Java.
I think most of the development time is not spent coding, but thinking. It is a very obvious statement, and yet too often ignored.</description>

      <description>Simple benchmark but with interesting comments here:
Some of the conclusions are:
Java interpreter is very good Java JIT is as fast as C++ Ruby, JavaScript, Python are of similar order of magnitude speed, Ruby the slowest. It would have been interesting to benchmark interpreted languages for the JVM.
Now for most projects, architecture, not language is key in achieving good performance.</description>

      <description>This Fowler article on &#34;language workbench&#34; reminds me of Gosling Jackpot ideas: it is about a different interaction with your program where the source code does not matter so much, but its structure. It must be fascinating to work on this kind of project.
Maybe MDA sounds similar to you, after all, actual language workbench systems are generating source code. But the fundamental difference is that a workbench generated program is much richer and can capture everything you want to do (MDA is too based on UML to be that powerful), also, the source could disappear and be replaced by byte codes only.</description>

      <description>Here is an example of how to use jython to deploy a web application under tomcat. The application is supposed here to be WAR packaged in a &#39;web&#39; directory. Libraries used for the web-app are already in web/WEB-INF/lib, classes are compiled automatically by Eclipse under web/WEB-INF/classes, and resources are copied automatically by Eclipse. If necessary, it is very easy to script those actions in the python script, with very little code.</description>

      <description>When Ant came out, I welcomed it. It was better than Makefiles for Java, it solved the path and classpath format difference between Windows and Linux, did not rely on shell programs. It did provide a platform independent way for building Java software. At that time, there was another alternative, JMK which had a lisp like syntax, and solved the same problems as Ant. But Ant was backed by apache, and this were the times of XML everywhere.</description>
