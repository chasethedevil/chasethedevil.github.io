  <h1>OO Desillusion</h1>
  <time datetime=2008-08-28T17:00:00Z class="post-date">Thu, Aug 28, 2008</time>
  <p>I have read many inspiring books about object oriented programming. I find <a href="http://archive.eiffel.com/doc/oosc/">B. Meyer Object Oriented Software Construction</a> one of the best in the lot. B. Meyer tries to explain in a progressive way why OO is better, by introducing it bit by bit. I have read different related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">design patterns</a> book, the GoF one, Martin Fowler ones. I have been programming Java for about 10 years now. And yet, today, I feel unconvinced.</p>
<p>Maybe it is because I have been recently on different bigger projects, maybe it is because I have worked with different people. What I see today, is a tendency to overcomplexity. A simple example is you need a code to do only 3 different things in particular cases. Instead of using if-then-else, because it reminds you of the devils of procedural programming, you write 3 classes and 1 interface. Now the usual excuse for such a behavior is to say, we don&rsquo;t know, maybe there will be a 4th one, my code will make it easy to handle the 4th one. Often when there are requirements change, you don&rsquo;t expect at all where it will be, and it is not what a developer thought would change that actually changes. So the dev with the 3 classes has now to change its interface, update the 3 classes, and create a 4th one. The &ldquo;procedural&rdquo; guy has no such problem because he did not try to abstract something that did not need any abstraction in the first place.</p>
<p>Now on millions lines of code software, it is important to have a few basic principles in the overall design, to identify components that talk to each other, to define a global structure. But at the developer dimension, there is often no need for that, except in the few cases where it makes sense.</p>
<p>I do use design patterns sometimes, when I feel it is the simplest flexible way, but it is quite rare overall. There are 2 common jokes about design patterns. One is from people who don&rsquo;t know what they are. They often take the piss of architects doing design patterns all the time that in the end don&rsquo;t really know how to do things and spend a lot of time and money on crap. Other is from Pythonists and Rubyists. They say that you do not need design patterns if the language is done right.</p>
<p>The Java language, with the Generics, and the propositions for <a href="http://java.dzone.com/news/java-7-predictions">Java 7</a> is also evolving in the overcomplex side (ok, the Generics are probably much worse than Java 7 propositions). Soon people will be more confortable reading <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>. Joke aside, Haskell while being different to read, has really something for it. It brings a new way of writing programs, moves the complexity somewhere else.</p>
<p>I still think lots of ideas in B. Meyer book are valid today. But an essential part must be missing. Overdesign seems to be too recurrent in OO projects.</p>
